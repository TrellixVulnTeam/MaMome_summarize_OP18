The fucose metabolism pathway score showed a direct relation-
ship  with  PPGR.  Fucose  is  a  sugar  molecule  that  various  microbial 
organisms  can  use  as  an  energy  source  [Chen  1987].  When  other 
carbohydrate sources are not available, gut microbiota can switch to 
using  the  fucose  that  can  be  obtained  from  the  hostâ€™s  gut  mucosal 
lining. This process is often carried out by microbes known as mucin 
degraders,  such  as  certain  species  of  genus  Ruminococcus  [Crost 
2016].  We  therefore  hypothesize  that  higher  fucose  consumption 
activity,  as  reflected  by  the  microbiome  pathway  score,  may  be  as-
sociated with microbiomes of those individuals who are either more 
likely  to  fast  or  whose  internal  ecosystem  and  overall  body  state 
resembles the conditions of fasting or calorie deprivation. This may 
explain its association with higher PPGR. More research is needed to
