the German pediatrician Teodor Escherich in 1885 (Shul-
man et al., 2007). The studies that followed shortly there-
after led to the description of representatives of a number
of the major gastrointestinal bacterial groups, including
the genera Bacteroides, Biﬁdobacterium, and Bacillus as
well as proteolytic cocci (Fl€ugge, 1886; Veillon & Zuber,
1898; Moro, 1900; Tissier, 1900; Passini, 1905; Tissier,
1908; Distaso, 1911). During this period that lasted till
the late sixties of the 20th century, Biﬁdobacterium and
Bacteroides spp. were considered to be the dominant
groups
tract. Aerobes,
referred as coliforms, streptococci and lactobacilli, were
found as minor groups, while clostridia, staphylococci
and aerobic spore-formers were reported as rare and not
always detectable (Haenel, 1970). However,
the vast
majority of the gastrointestinal microorganisms are now
known to be strict anaerobes, and this was for the ﬁrst
time shown in 1931 (Sanborn, 1931). Therefore, the early
cultivation studies provided only a partial view of the gas-
trointestinal microbiota and it enabled isolation of only a
minority of the gastrointestinal microorganisms
(Finegold, 1969)..

The present-day view of the gastrointestinal microbiota
composition is quite different than prior to the molecular
revolution. Most importantly, it is evident that still many
of the gastrointestinal microorganisms have not yet been
cultured and this in particular concerns phylogenetically
distinct bacterial groups belonging to the Firmicutes phy-
lum (Rajili(cid:1)c-Stojanovi(cid:1)c et al., 2007). Furthermore, several
of the bacterial groups that based on cultivation studies
had been recognized as dominant gastrointestinal genera,
have been reclassiﬁed and renamed. Most notably this
concerns the Bacteroides spp. that have been reclassiﬁed
into the genera Alistipes, Prevotella, Paraprevotella, Para-
bacteroides, and Odoribacter. Moreover, it is evident that
different members of the Bacteroidetes phylum and not the
Bacteroides genus sensu stricto are dominant in the human
gastrointestinal tract. Furthermore, the abundance of the
Peptostreptococcus spp. demonstrated in cultivation-based
studies, could primarily be attributed to Peptostreptococco-
cus productus (Holdeman et al., 1976). However, SSU
rRNA gene analysis has shown that this species does not
belong to the genus Peptostreptococcocus, and the species
was reclassiﬁed ﬁrst as Ruminococcus productus (Ezaki
et al., 1994) and ﬁnally as Blautia producta (Liu et al.,
2008). Today, it is clear that Blautia spp., in contrast to Pe-
ptostreptococcus spp.,
the most abundant
form one of
groups in the human gastrointestinal tract. Many other so-
called dominant genera are still in need for major reclassi-
ﬁcation, and the best example of this is the Clostridium
genus, for which a detailed phylogenetic analysis led to a
proposed grouping into 19 clusters (Collins et al., 1994).
Bacteria belonging to the Clostridium spp. are highly abun-
dant in the adult gastrointestinal tract, and in particular,
the members of the species that cluster within the Clostrid-
ium cluster IV (C. leptum group, which major constituent
is the Ruminococcacea family) and the Clostridium cluster
XIVa (C. coccoides group, which resembles the Lachnospir-
aceae family). Furthermore, the Ruminococcus genus is
polyphyletic or paraphyletic and its members cluster
within two families — the Ruminococcaceae and Lachno-
spiraceae. A recent metagenomic study reported that the
abundance of Ruminococcus spp. is a driver of one of the
proposed enterotype status of the microbiota (Arumugam
et al., 2011). However, as the present metagenomic analy-
ses do not provide accurate phylogenetic information, it is
unclear which of the two distinct groups of Ruminococcus
spp., is the actual driver of this enterotype status. This
example illustrates the need for a systematic and detailed.

very
dynamic, and in the last decade, 239 novel gastrointesti-
nal tract species have been detected or described, con-
ﬁrming the earlier notion that
the
gastrointestinal microorganisms are cultivable but not yet
cultured. While traditional cultivation media and strate-
gies are efﬁcient in obtaining novel species within the
Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria
phyla, for the detection of the gastrointestinal representa-
tives of the phyla Verrucomicrobia and Lentisphaerae, the

was needed (Zoetendal et al., 2003; Derrien et al., 2004).
This suggests that for the cultivation of the gastrointesti-
nal microorganisms belonging to phyla that lack any cul-
tured representatives
from the human intestine (e.g.,
TM7 candidate phylum or the Oscillospira genus), alter-
native and creative cultivation approaches
should be
developed and applied. Some new and promising devel-
opments include the use of high-throughput solid phase
growth
culturing
approaches using gnotobiotic mice (Goodman et al.,
2011), or gel microdroplet culturing (Fitzsimons et al.,
2013). The use of high-throughput culturing systems that
employ a large set of growth media coupled to genomic
characterization has proven to be very fruitful (Lagier
et al., 2012a; Dubourg et al., 2013; Hamad et al., 2013;
Pﬂeiderer et al., 2013). This recent attention for culturing
the gastrointestinal microorganisms reﬂects the perceived
need for detailed physiological, ecological and genetic
studies. While a variety of
functional metagenomics
it is the
approaches have been described and applied,
integration with culturing approaches that is needed to
further advance the understanding of the function of the
intestinal ecosystem in health and disease. The power of
this combination has recently been illustrated with the
example of the abundant mucus-utilizing bacterium, Akk-
ermansia muciniphila as a paradigm (Belzer & de Vos,.

Actinobacteria are common and abundant in the human
gastrointestinal tract. They are also known as gram-posi-
tive bacteria with a high G + C content in their DNA. As
they are particularly difﬁcult to lyse and their SSU RNA
needs speciﬁc PCR primers to be ampliﬁed (Satokari
et al., 2001), this group of bacteria is often underrepre-
sented in molecular surveys of the gastrointestinal micro-
biota (notably in one of the ﬁrst global studies of the
infants’ microbiota; Palmer et al., 2007). Members of the
orders Biﬁdobacteriales (in particular Biﬁdobacterium spp.)
and Coriobacteriales (mainly Collinsella spp.) are highly
prevalent already since early life, while members of the.

age (Scardovi & Trovatelli, 1974), an intestinal origin can
be suspected, showing the high adaption of this genus to
the gastrointestinal tract. Phylogenetically, Biﬁdobacterium
spp. form a homogenous group, with 20 cultured species
linked to the human gastrointestinal tract . The
ﬁrst Biﬁdobacterium spp. was recovered from infant feces
in 1900 by Henri Tissier, as a part of his PhD thesis work
(Tissier, 1900). It was named Bacillus biﬁdus-communis.
Already in 1924, this bacterium was renamed to Biﬁdo-
bacterium biﬁdum, but Biﬁdobacterium was not recognized
as an independent genus until 1974 (Biavati et al., 2000).
The members of the Biﬁdobacterium genus are nonmotile,

tate and lactate as major fermentation products from sug-

Coriobacteriales species constitute a frequently detected
group of the gastrointestinal microbiota composed of rep-
resentatives of 12 different genera . Collinsella is
the most dominant among other members of the order,
and a representative of these rod-shaped, nonmotile obli-
gate anaerobes was for the ﬁrst time detected in human
feces in 1935 (Eggerth, 1935). Both cultivation- and
molecular-based studies show that Collinsella aerofaciens
is a prevalent and an abundant gastrointestinal microor-
ganism (Moore & Holdeman, 1974a; Benno et al., 1986;
Kageyama et al., 2000). Four different types of Collinsella
aerofaciens were initially recognized and later reclassiﬁed
into distinct species (Kageyama & Benno, 2000). Collinsel-
la spp. can ferment a wide range of different carbohy-
drates including complex sugars, such as starch but also
glycogen to produce hydrogen gas, ethanol, formate, and
lactate (Eggerth, 1935; Kageyama et al., 1999a). Experi-
ments with an in vitro model of the human colon showed
that Collinsella spp. along with Biﬁdobacterium spp. are
the major lactose utilizers in the human gastrointestinal.

Eggerthella are assacharolytic bacteria that produce
acids only from glucose, but not from other sugars. The
ﬁrst representative of this bacterial group was isolated in
1935 by Arnold Eggerth (Eggerth, 1935). These bacteria
produce formate and lactate. Until now, only Eggerthella
lenta and the still not fully characterized Eggerthella sp.
YY7918 are associated with the human gastrointestinal
tract. Eggerthella lenta has been implied in producing
anti-tumor substances that stimulate natural killer cells
(Hatta, 1995), while Eggerthella sp. YY7918 has been
reported to produce s-equol (Yokoyama & Suzuki, 2008),
which has anticarcinogenic properties (Yuan et al., 2007).
Slackia spp. are asaccharolytic bacteria with the com-
mon feature of converting dietary isoﬂavones. These isof-
lavones have been proposed to prevent hormone-
dependent diseases, while their conversion by gastrointes-
tinal bacteria
effectiveness.
Among the bacterial products, s-equol appears to be the
most relevant to human physiology (Yuan et al., 2007).
At least two Slackia spp. are capable of equol production
from isoﬂavones (Matthies et al., 2009; Jin et al., 2010),
while Adlercreutzia equolifaciens that also belongs to the
Coriobacteriales order, is another gastrointestinal species
capable to produce equol (Maruo et al., 2008). The ability
to produce s-equol is more abundant among microbiota
of Asian than the Caucasian subjects (Song et al., 2006)
and can be explained by the adaptation of the microbiota
isoﬂavones — particularly
to the higher availability of
those derived from soy beans..

Atopobium species are anaerobic bacteria that cluster
within the Actionobacteria phylum, and, in contrast to the
rest of the phylum, contain DNA with a low G + C con-
tent. The main product of their metabolism is lactate,
which is in line with the previous classiﬁcation of these
bacteria within the Lactobacillus and Streptococcus genera
(Collins & Wallbanks, 1992). Based on the literature data,
it can be concluded that Atopobium spp. are among the
earliest colonizers of the human intestinal tract as they
are reported to be present in gastrointestinal contents of
6-week-old infants (Fallani et al., 2011). However, the
data on Atopobium quantiﬁcation are based on the appli-
cation of a FISH probe for the Atopobium cluster, which
that
in addition to Atopobium, hybridizes
belong to the Coriobacterium, Eggerthella and Collinsella
genera (Harmsen et al., 2000). Therefore, it is not clear if
the Atopobium or the other targeted genera are colonizing
the gastrointestinal tract of infants. Bacteria belonging to
the Atopobium cluster are signiﬁcantly associated with the
major products of protein fermentation, suggesting that.

of this group were detected only in studies that speciﬁ-
cally targeted this group of bacteria (Hoyles et al., 2013),
or in studies that targeted low abundant bacteria within
the gastrointestinal microbiota (Lagier et al., 2012a; Du-
bourg et al., 2013). Various different Actinomycetales spe-
cies, of which many are still uncultured, were identiﬁed
in a molecular study of
these speciﬁc subcommunity
within the gastrointestinal microbiota of healthy humans
of different ages, showing a high prevalence of these bac-
teria (Hoyles et al., 2013). The most diverse and the fre-
quently

Actinomycetales

Corynebacterium spp. . These bacteria typically
colonize the human skin and are found in high abun-
dance in infants that are born using Caesarean section.

(Dominguez-Bello et al., 2010). In adults, Corynebacte-
rium spp. are more frequently detected in the samples of
the upper gastrointestinal
tract (Justesen et al., 1984).
Cultivation studies have indicated that Propionibacterium
spp. are the major proteolytic bacteria in the human
intestine (Macfarlane et al., 1986). Propionibacterium spp.
are applied as probiotics as they are major vitamin B12
producers and produce propionate from lactate. In vitro
experiments showed that the metabolic products of two
gastrointestinal Propionibacterium spp. can induce apop-
tosis of colorectal carcinoma cells (Jan et al., 2002)..

Bacteria belonging to the Rhodococcus genus are rarely
detected in the human gastrointestinal microbiota but
have been found in an extreme abundance (up to 68%)
in mucosal biopsies of ulcerative colitis patients (Lepage
et al., 2011). Mycobacterium spp., notably Mycobacterium
avium, have also been implied in ulcerative colitis and
the expression of intestinal cells in inﬂammatory bowel
disease patients appears to have similarities to Mycobacte-
rium infection (Sibartie et al., 2010)..

The gastrointestinal Actinomycetales also include Rothia
spp. that are frequently detected in the upper gastrointesti-
nal tract (Ou et al., 2009), but rarely in fecal samples. These
species contribute to the degradation of gluten (Zamakh-
chari et al., 2011) and their abundance and activity might
be relevant for celiac disease and other conditions related
to gluten digestion. Another species of this order — Actino-
myces graevenitzii — which is detected in an increased
abundance in the small intestine of celiac disease patients,
might be a relevant risk factor for the development of this
disease (Ou et al., 2009). Various other Actinomyces spp.
can be detected in low abundance in the fecal samples of
healthy humans (Hoyles et al., 2012; Hoyles et al., 2013),
and while the role of these bacteria in the gastrointestinal
tract is still to be determined, it is noteworthy that an Acti-
nomyces spp. was detected as colonizer of the infant gastro-
intestinal tract using sensitive molecular methods already
in the ﬁrst days of life (Favier et al., 2002)..

Micrococcus spp. are relatively prevalent (present
in
20% of the analyzed subjects) in the samples of the upper
gastrointestinal tract in patients predisposed to the devel-
opment of the small intestinal bacterial overgrowth syn-
drome (Bouhnik et al., 1999). Although representatives of
this genus can be detected in the fecal samples (Finegold
et al., 1974), these bacteria typically inhabit human skin.
Similar applies to six Kocuria spp., which are human skin
and oropharynx mucosa commensals (Savini et al., 2010),
although two recent studies have reported presence of
Kocuria spp.
in gastrointestinal samples (Lagier et al.,
2012a; Fitzsimons et al., 2013).
The other members of.

The Gram-negative bacteria that belong to the phylum
Bacteroidetes are common, abundant and diverse within
the human gastrointestinal tract. The ﬁrst Bacteroides spe-
cies — Bacteroides fragilis — was isolated in 1898 as a
human pathogen linked to appendicitis among other clin-
ical cases (Veillon & Zuber, 1898). Although some Bacte-
roides
spp. are still considered to be opportunistic
pathogens, several decades of research have testiﬁed that
many Bacteroidetes species are highly adjusted to the gas-
trointestinal tract, where they live in high abundance (up
(cid:1)1 of intestinal material; Eggerth & Gagnon,
to 1011 cells g
1933; Moore & Holdeman, 1974a; Benno et al., 1986).
Hence,
that are
they perform metabolic conversions
essential for the host, often related to the degradation of
proteins or complex sugar polymers. The colonization of
the gastrointestinal tract with the Bacteroidetes is pro-
moted already in infants, as mother milk’s nondigestible
oligosaccharides support the growth of both Bacteroides
and Biﬁdobacterium spp. (Marcobal et al., 2011). Further-
more, animal model experiments have shown that the
colonization of the normal gastrointestinal tract, as illus-
trated by experiments with pure cultures of Bacteroides
spp., is a result of the recognition and selection by the
immune system of
(Rakoff-Nahoum et al.,
2004), mediated through the toll-like receptors (Round
et al., 2011; Lopez-Siles et al., 2012) and other speciﬁc
host-microorganism interactions (Hooper et al., 2012)..

For a long time, it was thought that the majority of
Gram-negative gastrointestinal tract bacteria belonged to
the Bacteroides genus, but in recent years many earlier
designed Bacteroides spp. were assigned to other genera
within the Bacteroidetes phylum. Currently, only four gas-
trointestinal Bacteroides spp. form deep branches in the
phylogenetic tree , suggesting that these bacteria
and
(B. ureolyticus, B. galacturonicus, B. pectinophilus,
B. coagulans) still should be reclassiﬁed to other phyloge-
netic groups. A similar situation applies to Anaerorhabdus
furcosa, which is still classiﬁed as a member of the Bacter-
family, but based on its SSU rRNA gene
oidaceae
sequence clusters within the Firmicutes phylum. The
majority of the gastrointestinal Bacteroidetes spp. belongs.

belonging to the genera Alistipes, Bacteroides, Parabactero-

can degrade complex plant polysaccharides such as starch,
cellulose, xylans, and pectins (Wu et al., 1992; Morotomi

tes species play also an important role in protein metabo-
lism, as some species have proteolytic activity, assigned to
the proteases that are linked to the cell wall (Macfarlane
et al., 1986; Macfarlane et al., 1988), while some Bactero-
ides spp. have a potential to utilize urea as a nitrogen
source (Yatsunenko et al., 2012). Other important func-
tions of Bacteroides spp. include the deconjugation of bile
acids (Narushima et al., 2006) and growth on mucus (Le-
itch et al., 2007). The Bacteroidetes contribute to the
recently proposed classiﬁcation of
the gastrointestinal
microbiota into enterotypes (Arumugam et al., 2011).
The importance of the Bacteroidetes is further illustrated
by the fact that this group is the most stable component
of the gastrointestinal microbiota over time in healthy
adults (Rajili(cid:1)c-Stojanovi(cid:1)c et al., 2013b). Anecdotally, a
unique case report described the microbiota of a critically
ill patient that harbored no Bacteroidetes — this patient
passed away soon after sampling (Dubourg et al., 2013)..

complex: while the reduced abundance of the Bacteroide-
tes in some cases is associated with obesity (Ley, 2010)
and irritable bowel syndrome (Rajili(cid:1)c-Stojanovi(cid:1)c et al.,
2011),
this bacterial group appears to be enriched in
patients suffering from type 1 and type 2 diabetes (Larsen
et al., 2010). Moreover, Bacteroides spp.
in contrast to
Prevotella spp. were recently found to be enriched in the
metagenomes of subjects with low gene richness that were
associated with adiposity, insulin resistance and dyslipida-
emia as well as an inﬂammatory phenotype (Le Chatelier
et al., 2013)..

Bacteroidetes species that belong to classes Flavobacteri-
ales and Sphingobacteriales are only occasionally detected
in the gastrointestinal tract . With an
exception of Capnocytophaga spp. and Sphingobacterium
spp. that can be detected in the human oral cavity, the
other bacteria of this group are typically associated with
other ecosystems (primarily soil). There is no data about
the role of these bacteria in the gastrointestinal microbi-
ota, but it is noteworthy that several of these bacteria
were detected only in the SSU rRNA gene clone libraries
of the microbiota of inﬂammatory bowel disease patients
(Frank et al., 2007)..

studies have
content
shown that Gram-positive staining is not a feature of
many Firmicutes. This can be illustrated with Faecalibacte-
rium prausnitzii, which is a Gram-negative-staining bacte-
rium, previously classiﬁed within the Fusobacteria phylum
(Duncan et al., 2002a), novel gastrointestinal isolates such
as Christensenella minuta (Morotomi et al., 2012), but
also typical Gram-negative bacteria such as members of
the Veillonellacea family (Marchandin et al., 2010). While
the vast majority of the Firmicutes are indeed low GC
content bacteria, this also, is not a common feature of
the phylum as seen in an example of Anaerofustis ster-
corihominis, which DNA has a content of the GC of
around 70% (Finegold et al., 2004). Most of the Firmi-
cutes, notably the Clostridium spp. and Bacillus spp., are
spore-formers and this property confers special survival
value in and beyond the gastrointestinal tract..

The most abundant gastrointestinal microorganisms
are members of the class Clostridia and within this class
the families Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae (Tap
et al., 2009;
Jalanka-Tuovinen et al., 2011). Another
diverse group of the Firmicutes is the class Bacilli that
includes the genera of Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, and
Streptococcus, which are dominant in the upper part of
the gastrointestinal tract. In line with its enormous diver-
sity, the Firmicutes in the gastrointestinal tract perform a
number of different functions that stretch from health
promoting of some probiotic Lactobacillus spp. to patho-
genic properties of Clostridium difﬁcile. The vast majority
inhabitants
of the currently uncultured gastrointestinal
belong to the phylum Firmicutes (Rajili(cid:1)c-Stojanovi(cid:1)c et al.,
2007), which illustrates that future research is expected to
dramatically expand our knowledge about the functional
contribution of this group to the ecosystem and the host..

The ﬁrst representative of the Bacilli class retrieved from
the gastrointestinal tract was a member of Lactobacillales
order and was isolated in 1900 — Bacillus acidophilus
(Moro, 1900). The description of this species is vague,
based on the currently accepted standards, and as the ori-
ginal strain was lost, it is not clear if this species is Lacto-
bacillus acidophilus or one of
the other ﬁve species
derived from the so-called L. acidophilus group (Mits-
uoka, 1992). Lactobacilli comprise a group of gastrointes-
inhabitants that has received particular scientiﬁc
tinal
attention (Tannock, 2004), mainly because of the health
claims proposed by Metchnikoff in the beginning
of the nineteenth century and their later application as
probiotics. Although highly important for the health, Lac-
tobacilli are rarely detected as markers of the gastrointes-
tinal microbiota dysbiosis, but such reports exist and.

include a reduced abundance in patients suffering from
inﬂammatory bowel disease (Keighley et al., 1978; Ott
et al., 2004), type 1 diabetes (Murri et al., 2013). This
might be related to the fact that lactobacilli are only a
minor fraction of the fecal microbiota where they can
(cid:1)1 (Simon & Gorbach,
reach counts of up to 108 cells g
1984), and most of the analysis of the gastrointestinal
microbiota is based on the use of stool samples. In the
small intestine Lactobacillus spp. represent one of the pre-
dominant groups obtained by culturing (Reuter, 2001).
However, while molecular studies could conﬁrm their
presence in the upper intestinal tract, these also showed
that the Lactobacilli are quite variable and not as abun-
dant as other gastrointestinal genera at that location, such
as Streptococcus and Veillonella (Booijink, 2009; Booijink
et al., 2010). This may explain why Lactobacillus spp.
should be part of the diet, as consumed probiotic strains
of Lactobacillus spp. have a beneﬁcial effect on human
health and speciﬁc induction of gene expression has been
observed in duodenal biopsies after exposure of Lactoba-
cillus plantarum (van Baarlen et al., 2009). Speciﬁc media,
developed already in the 1950s (Rogosa et al., 1951),
enabled the isolation of numerous Lactobacillus spp. Nev-
ertheless, new Lactobacillus spp. from human gastrointes-
tinal tract are still being reported (Roos et al., 2005; Oki
et al., 2012), indicating that even the 38 known gastroin-
testinal Lactobacillus sp.  are not covering the
group’s full diversity. Several previously misclassiﬁed Lac-
tobacillus spp. have now been reclassiﬁed into novel gen-
and
including Weissella, Atopobium, Eggerthia,
era,
Kandleria (Collins & Wallbanks, 1992; Bjorkroth et al.,
2002; Salvetti et al., 2011). Currently, only Lactobacillus
rogosae is strongly outgrouping from the remaining Lacto-
bacillus spp., although even after exclusion of the strongly
outgrouping species, the species show a large degree of
the SSU rRNA gene variation and form several groups in
the phylogenetic tree  As Lactobacillus spp. pro-
duce lactic acid as the major fermentation production
that can be accompanied with ethanol and carbon dioxide
in some species and under some conditions, traditionally
Lactobacillus spp. are classiﬁed into three groups: obli-
gately homofermentative, facultatively homofermentative,
and obligately heterofermentative. However, the phyloge-
netic position of the species does not seem to be related
to their fermentation proﬁle..

In addition to Lactobacillus spp., other related,.

lactic
acid bacteria can be detected in the gastrointestinal tract.
Members of the genera Leuconostoc and Weissella used to
be considered as occasional and possibly transient mem-
bers of the gastrointestinal microbiota. However, a recent
study showed that Leuconostoc spp. and Weissella spp. are
abundant (representing up to 24% of
total microbial
community) and widely distributed in colonic mucosa.

conostoc was identiﬁed as the most abundant bacterial
genus, representing almost a quarter of the total micro-
bial community in a group of meconium samples of new-
borns, which persisted in the gastrointestinal tract until
7 months of age (Gosalbes et al., 2013). In the same
study, Weissella spp. were also detected as the earliest col-
onizers of the gastrointestinal tract of some newborns.
These bacteria utilize simple sugars and their presence in
the lower parts of the gastrointestinal tract is dependent
on the activity of other gastrointestinal microorganisms
that have the ability to degrade complex sugars, resistant
to human digestive enzymes..

tococcus and Enterococcus. These two genera have only
recently been separated, although the presence of the sub-
group within the genus Streptococcus was noticed as late
as in the 1930s (Sherman, 1938). They are one of the
dominant bacterial
fractions in the upper part of the
small intestine (Simon & Gorbach, 1986; Reuter, 2001).
Forty-six species of these two genera are known to be gas-
trointestinal inhabitants . In addition, Streptococ-
the
cus pleomorphus, which also can be part of
gastrointestinal microbiota, forms a deep branch in the
SSU rRNA gene sequence–based phylogenetic tree, sug-
gesting that
should be reclassiﬁed into
another genus within the Erysipelotrichaceae family. The
ample presence of the Enterococcus and Streptococcus spp.
can be explained by the fact that the species are oxygen.

group, Enterococcus faecalis, was for the ﬁrst time plated
in 1899 from a case of endocarditis (MacCallum & Has-
tings, 1899), and only 7 years later it was recovered from
intestinal
samples (Andrewes & Horder, 1906). Both
Streptococcus and Enterococcus spp. are among the ﬁrst
tract
established species in the infant’s gastrointestinal
that can be detected already in the ﬁrst day of life (Sol(cid:1)ıs
et al., 2010; Gosalbes et al., 2013). Although this early.

presence would suggest an important role in the ecosys-
tem, the data on the role of Streptococcus and Enterococcus
in human health are conﬂicting. Enterococcus spp.
spp.
are widely
recognized as opportunistic pathogens,
although these species are common, and can even exhibit
probiotic properties ( (cid:1)O Cu(cid:1)ıv et al., 2013). The abundance
of a Streptococcus species is decreased in mucosal biopsies
in Crohn’s disease patients (Li et al., 2012), while Strepto-
coccus and Enterococcus phylotypes are found to be.

increased in fecal samples of colorectal cancer patients
(Wang et al., 2012). However, in the adult gastrointesti-
nal tract, Streptococcus spp. are particularly abundant in
the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract, where they are
active in the process of simple sugar fermentation into
lactate (Zoetendal et al., 2012). Moreover, they may form
a tropic chain with the equally abundant Veillonella spp.
that

Various members of the Bacillales order can be low-
level constituents of the human gastrointestinal microbi-
ota (Figs 10 and 11 — for clarity the phylogenetic tree of
this numerous order was split into two parts). Among
them, a large number of Staphylococcus spp., which typi-.

in the human gastrointestinal tract . These bacte-
ria are one of the earliest colonizers of the gastrointestinal
tract, particularly in infants that were delivered by cesar-
ean section (Dominguez-Bello et al., 2010). The predomi-
nant
is,
however, coupled with several health risks, as it induces
strong stimulation of the immune system, which can be a
trigger for the development of asthma and rhinitis in later
childhood (Johansson et al., 2012). Furthermore, pre-
dominant colonization of the gastrointestinal tract of pre-
mature infants with Staphylococcus spp. is associated with
fatal sepsis (Madan et al., 2012). An increased abundance

Gemella spp. are abundant in the upper gastrointestinal
tract and specially the proximal small intestine (Ou et al.,
2009). While their function in the gastrointestinal tract
has not been determined, these species can include patho-
genic strain that translocate to other organs. For instance,
Gemella spp. have been described as likely causing agents
of endocarditis, particularly in patients that suffer from
gastrointestinal disorders (such as colon cancer; Lopez-
Dupla et al., 1996)..

Numerous members of the Bacillus and Paenibacillus
genera have been detected in the samples of the human gas-
trointestinal tract. The ﬁrst representatives of this group of
bacteria were isolated in 1919 by Marjorie Batchelor, who
reported Bacillus cereus as the most prevalent member of
the aerobic sporogenic bacteria in infant feces (Batchelor,
1919). Members of the Bacillus genus were often reported
in the older cultivation-based studies, but the vast majority
this genus and related genera were
of
reported only recently (Hoyles et al., 2012; Lagier et al.,
2012a; Zoetendal et al., 2012). One of these studies was
designed for the targeted cultivation of Bacillus and related
species from human samples (Hoyles et al., 2012). It has
been shown that Bacillus spp. could be retrieved from all
analyzed samples, although these bacteria have very low
abundance of 102–104 cells mL
intestinal content.
Many of the Bacillus spp. isolated in this study exhibited
notable antimicrobial activity. This feature is in line with
the use of several Bacillus spp. as potent probiotics with
immunomodulatory potential (Duc et al., 2004). Little is
known about the function of these bacteria in the ecosys-
tem, but it is noteworthy that two independent studies have
shown that members of the Bacillales order, more speciﬁ-
cally Aneurinibacillus spp., have an increased abundance in
(Krogius-
feces of
Kurikka et al., 2009; Rajili(cid:1)c-Stojanovi(cid:1)c et al., 2011), while a
signiﬁcantly higher abundance of Bacillus subtilis was found
in the feces of bottle-fed than breast-fed babies (Benno
et al., 1984)..

geneous and many of its members were initially assigned
to Clostridium genus and subsequently reclassiﬁed into
novel genera. The Clostridium sensu stricto — the real
Clostridium spp. — are grouped around the type species
Clostridium butyricum and belong to the Clostridium clus-
ter I within the Clostridiaceae family (Fig. 12; Stacke-
brandt et al., 1999). In addition to Clostridium spp., the
Clostridiaceae ofﬁcially groups Sarcina spp., Butyricicoccus
pullicaecorum and Lactonifactor longoviformis, Anoxynatro-
num sibiricum while the latter three, based on their SSU
rRNA gene sequence, should be assigned to various other
Clostridiales
(Figs 13, 14 and 16). The ﬁrst
human gastrointestinal Clostridium isolate, C. perfringens,
was recovered in 1905 (Passini, 1905). The same species,
previously known as Bacillus aerogenes capsulatus and
Clostridium welchii, was earlier isolated from a case of
endocarditis (Welch & Nuttall, 1892). Both isolation sites
ﬁt
the nowadays known properties of C. perfringens,
which is a commensal gastrointestinal bacterium that can
cause bacteraemia (Petit et al., 1999). Up to now, 72
Clostridium spp. have been detected in the human gastro-
intestinal samples, of which 30 belong to the Clostridium
sensu stricto . The other Clostridium spp. belong
to different families within the Firmicutes phylum, while
Clostridium rectum belongs to the Fusobacteria phylum.
Members of the Clostridium sensu stricto are generally
perceived as pathogenic, although cultivation-based stud-
ies show that C. perfringens and other real clostridia can
(cid:1)1 intestinal
be found in densities of up to 1010 cells g
content of healthy individuals (Finegold et al., 1974), and
up 107 cells g
intestinal content of healthy infants
(Mevissen-Verhage et al., 1987). Still,
the presence of
these bacteria, notably as seen for C. perfringens in elderly
is interpreted as an indicator of a less
Irish subjects,
healthy microbiota (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2013)..

The most abundant and diverse gastrointestinal family
is the Lachnospiraceae. This family groups 24 different
genera, most of which can be detected in the human gas-
trointestinal tract. In addition, a number of species that
are ofﬁcially classiﬁed into the genera Clostridium, Eubac-
terium, and Ruminococcus, cluster within the Lachnospira-
ceae based on their SSU rRNA gene sequence .
Members of the Lachnospiraceae are also among the ﬁrst
to be established in the gastrointestinal tract. A recent
study showed that Ruminococcus gnavus is an exclusive
representative of this family in 2-months old breast-fed
infants, while infants fed with cow-milk based formula
have a more diverse Lachnospiraceae community (Tan-
nock et al., 2013). Analysis of the microbiota of children
and adults showed that this group of bacteria is predomi-
nant in both young children and in adults, which indicates
the early establishment of these bacteria (Ringel-Kulka
et al., 2013)..

the Lachnospiraceae family are
butyrate producers including Anaerostipes spp., Butyrivib-
rio spp., Coprococcus spp., Roseburia spp., Eubacterium
rectale- and Eubacterium hallii-related species. Butyrate
can be used as an energy source by the gut epithelial cells,
and it has anticarcinogenic and anti-inﬂammatory prop-
erties (Hamer et al., 2008). Furthermore, a recent study
shows that butyrate produced by intestinal microorgan-
isms has beneﬁcial effects on glucose and energy homeo-
stasis (De Vadder et al., 2014). The decrease in the
relative abundance of the butyrate-producing Lachnospir-
aceae in the gastrointestinal microbiota is associated with
compromised health status of subjects suffering from
colorectal cancer (Wang et al., 2012), ulcerative colitis
(Rajili(cid:1)c-Stojanovi(cid:1)c et al., 2013a),
type 1 (Murri et al.,
2013) and type 2 diabetes (Qin et al., 2012). This bacte-.

The gastrointestinal Lachnospiraceae include Dorea spp.,
which are the major gas producers in the gastrointestinal
tract and its end-products of glucose fermentation include
both hydrogen and carbon dioxide (Taras et al., 2002).
Dorea spp. were found in an increased in abundance in
both pediatric
syndrome
patients (Rajili(cid:1)c-Stojanovi(cid:1)c et al., 2011; Saulnier et al.,

bloating, experienced by the majority of these patients..

Blautia is a recently described bacterial genus that
groups
several abundant gastrointestinal bacteria that
were previously assigned to the Ruminococcus genus –
notably those related to Ruminococcus obeum .
The common feature of Blautia spp. is the utilization of
hydrogen and carbon dioxide to form acetate (Bernalier
et al., 1996). Blautia spp. are among the most abundant
tract and can
the entire gastrointestinal
members of
encompass between 2.5% and 16% of the total microbi-
ota (Zoetendal et al., 2002). This abundant bacterial
group is signiﬁcantly depleted in elderly subjects (Hayashi
et al., 2003; Biagi et al., 2010) and in mucosal samples of
colorectal cancer patients (Chen et al., 2012). In contrast,
increased levels of Blautia spp. are observed in irritable
bowel syndrome patients (Rajili(cid:1)c-Stojanovi(cid:1)c et al., 2011),
but this could reﬂect the adaption of the ecosystem to
the larger amount of gasses produced by Dorea spp.,
which can be utilized by Blautia spp..

An interesting group within the Lachnospiraceae family
is the misclassiﬁed Ruminococcus spp., including R. gna-
vus, R. torques, R. lactaris, and R. faecis. These bacteria
are abundant in the gastrointestinal tract (Holdeman &
Moore, 1974), and apparently associated with a number.

of important metabolic functions. R. torques and other
currently uncultured species related to R. torques, are
among the most potent mucus utilizes that enable mucus
degradation by secretion of several different extracellular
glycosidases
the
abundance of these bacteria is strongly associated with
the level of triglycerides in blood serum (Lahti et al.,
2013). Several studies of the microbiota of irritable bowel
syndrome patients and controls have shown that organ-
isms related to these misclassiﬁed Ruminococcus spp. are
signiﬁcantly elevated in patients (Kassinen et al., 2007;
Rajili(cid:1)c-Stojanovi(cid:1)c
et al., 2011).
Moreover, the abundance of these bacteria is positively
correlated with irritable bowel syndrome symptoms (Mal-
inen et al., 2010) and signiﬁcantly reduced by probiotics
consumption that reduces these symptoms (Lyra et al.,
2010)..

The Ruminococcaceae family is another relevant group
of gastrointestinal bacteria within the Clostridiales order.
It includes the true Ruminococcus spp. — members of the
sensu stricto namely R. albus, R. bromii,
Ruminococcus
R. callidus, R. champanellensis, and R. ﬂavefaciens. Several
other frequently detected gastrointestinal genera that are.

recognized members of the Clostridium cluster IV (Clos-
tridium leptum group) are either members or are closely
related to this family . The true Ruminococcus
spp. are an abundant fraction of the human gastrointesti-

Being strictly anaerobic cellulolytic cocci, Ruminococcus
spp. were isolated from human gastrointestinal samples
only after the improvement of the anaerobic techniques
and media for
(Hungate,
1947). The ﬁrst human gastrointestinal Ruminococcus spp.
reported is Ruminococcus bromii isolated in 1972 (Moore
et al., 1972). Similar to the other gastrointestinal bacteria,
the initially deﬁned Ruminococcus spp. are a heteroge-
neous group, which based on the SSU rRNA gene
sequence clusters within the Ruminococcaceae and Lachno-
spiraceae families. Recently, ﬁve gastrointestinal Rumino-
coccus spp. were reclassiﬁed into Blautia genus,
leaving
seven others to be reclassiﬁed (Liu et al., 2008; Figs 9 and
10). Bacteria that belong to the Ruminococcus sensu stricto
degrade complex sugars to produce acetate as the major
fermentation product. Both in vitro and in vivo studies
have shown that R. bromii is the major degrader of the
resistant starch in the human gastrointestinal tract (Ko-
vatcheva-Datchary et al., 2009; Walker
et al., 2011).
Application of the resistant starch in the diet has a wide
range of health-promoting effects, suggesting the impor-
tance of the metabolic activity of R. bromii for the wellbe-
ing of the host (Higgins & Brown, 2013). The importance
of the members of the Ruminococcus sensu stricto for the
intestinal health is indicated by their reduced abundance
in feces of Crohn’s disease (Kang et al., 2010) and ulcera-
tive colitis patients (Rajili(cid:1)c-Stojanovi(cid:1)c et al., 2013a)..

Among the Ruminococcaceae family, Faecalibacterium
prausnitzii (previously known as Fusobacterium prausnitzii)
is the most prevalent and abundant gastrointestinal micro-
organism (Holdeman et al.,
1976). Faecalibacterium
prausnitzii can utilize glucose, fructose, and fructo-oligosa-
charides, as well as complex molecules such as pectin and
N-acetylglucosamine to produce butyrate, formate and lac-
tate (Duncan et al., 2002a; Lopez-Siles et al., 2012). It is
one of the major butyrate producers in the gastrointestinal
tract, which is a relevant feature because of the health-pro-
moting properties of butyrate. The reduced abundance of
this bacterium is detected in association with Crohn’s dis-
ease (Sokol et al., 2006; Kang et al., 2010) and with colon
cancer (Chen et al., 2012). This bacterium is important for
the gastrointestinal microbiota homeostasis as it has found
to show anti-inﬂammatory properties in mice (Sokol et al.,
2008) and is associated with a range of metabolic processes
in the human mucosa (Lepage et al., 2011). Health-pro-
moting properties are also exhibited by B. pullicaecorum,
another species with the SSU rRNA gene sequence that is.

related to the Ruminococcaceae family. This bacterium is
signiﬁcantly reduced in inﬂammatory bowel disease
patients, while its oral administration strengthens the epi-
thelial barrier function in animal models by increasing the
trans-epithelial resistance (Eeckhaut et al., 2013)..

The ﬁrst Eubacterium spp. from a human gastrointesti-
nal sample was isolated already in 1908 when Henri Tis-
sier plated Bacillus
renamed into
ventriousus,
Eubacterium ventriosum (Tissier, 1908). The genus Eubac-
terium was for a long time recognized as one of the most
abundant genera of the human gastrointestinal microbi-
(cid:1)1 of intestinal
ota, with densities of up to 1010 cells g
content (Moore & Holdeman, 1974a). However, Eubacte-
rium, similar to Clostridium,
is very
rod-shaped,
vaguely described. Deﬁned as anaerobic,
Gram-positive bacteria that do not
form endospores,
Eubacterium genus includes a consortium of distantly
related species. Some Eubacterium spp. have been reclassi-
ﬁed into novel genera within two bacterial phyla —
Actinobacteria and Firmicutes — of which six genera
(Dorea, Collinsella, Eggerthella, Flavonifractor, Mogibacteri-
um and Pseuodramibacter) can be members of the gastro-
intestinal microbiota (Willems & Collins, 1996; Kageyama
et al., 1999a, b; Nakazawa et al., 2000; Taras et al., 2002;
Carlier et al., 2010). Further reclassiﬁcation of the genus
can be expected, as only four gastrointestinal Eubacterium
spp. belong to the Eubacterium sensu stricto . In
a recent study of the gastrointestinal microbiota of cente-
narians, Eubacterium spp. (notably those related to Eubac-
terium limosum) were reported as signature bacteria of
the long life, being 10-fold increased in centenarians
(Biagi et al., 2010). It is known that E. limosum has the
ability to transform dietary phytoestrogens into forms
that might have a positive impact on health (Clavel et al.,
2006; Possemiers & Verstraete, 2009). Furthermore,
E. limosum is selectively stimulated by prebiotics that
improve the symptoms of
inﬂammatory bowel disease
patients (Kanauchi et al., 2005)..

Mogibacterium is a genus established by reclassiﬁcation
of the intestinal bacterium – Eubacterium timidum. Mogi-
bacterium spp. are enriched in mucosa-associated micro-
biota in colon cancer patients but not much is known
about this group of bacteria belonging to Clostridium
Family XIII Incertae Sedis (Chen et al., 2012)..

Clostridium) belong to the Peptostreptococcaceae family
according to their SSU rRNA gene sequence .
Members of the Peptostreptococcaceae family are, in prin-

Although C. difﬁcile can be present in low numbers in
healthy subjects without exhibiting pathogenic properties
(Ozaki et al., 2004), many strains are toxin producing
and are well-established pathogens that cause severe diar-

members of the Peptococcaceae family form two paraphy-
letic groups within the Firmicutes phylum, of which the
group that contains the two human gastrointestinal bacte-
ria is closely related to Negativicutes class and is discussed
in the following section..

stridia class, form distinct branches in the phylogenetic
tree . Two of
these gastrointestinal bacteria,
namely Catabacter hongkongensis and C. minuta, form a
the
separate cluster within the Clostridiales order of
Clostridia class and are the only cultured representatives
of a phylogenetic group that was previously detected only
in various molecular studies and was in a previous review
designated as uncultured Clostridiales II (Rajili(cid:1)c-Stojano-
vi(cid:1)c et al., 2007). These two species are ofﬁcially assigned
to two different families (Catabacteriaceae and Christense-
nellaceae), although based on the SSU rRNA gene
sequence similarity  they should be grouped in
the same family, and, most likely,
in the same genus.
Catabacter hongkongensis was isolated in 2007 from a
blood sample, although the intestinal origin of the bacte-
rium was suspected (Lau et al., 2007). This bacterium
was later isolated from patients with acute appendicitis,
but also from other tissues where it was a causative agent
of fatal bacteremia (Lau et al., 2012). Christensenella min-
uta is an intestinal isolate, described in 2012 (Morotomi
et al., 2012). Not much is known about the role of this
group of strictly anaerobic bacteria in the human gastro-
intestinal tract, but it is noteworthy that bacteria that
belong to the Christensenella/Catabacter group were
reported to be dramatically depleted in fecal
samples of ulcerative patients relative to controls (Rajili(cid:1)c-

(Van Eldere et al., 1987). This
P. niger makes it an important player in enterophatic cir-
culation of various steroid molecules, primarily steroid
hormones, which has a major impact on human metabo-
lism. Another member of the Peptococcaceae family, Des-
ulﬁtobacterium hafniense, has been reported only once as
an inhabitant of the human gastrointestinal tract (van de
Pas et al., 2001). In contrast to other members of the
genus, the human D. hafniense is not able to use chloro-
ethenes or chlorophenol as terminal electron acceptors
(Smidt & de Vos, 2004). This bacterium is capable of
using sulﬁte as terminal electron acceptor and hence pro-
duces hydrogen sulﬁde. Hydrogen sulﬁde is also produced
by P. niger (Wilkins et al., 1975), and this property that
may be detrimental to health as described below for the
Deltaproteobacteria..

Finally, Halanaerobaculum tunisiense has been identiﬁed
by pyrosequencing of the V6 variable region of the SSU

The Negativicutes include bacteria that were previously
assigned to the Clostridium cluster IX (Collins et al.,

lowing genera: Acidamoinococcus, Dialister, Megamonas,
Megasphaera,
Veillonella
this group used to be classiﬁed
. Bacteria of
within the order Clostridiales, although based on their
SSU rRNA gene sequence, they are distant from other
Clostridiales. Therefore,
following the description of a
novel gastrointestinal inhabitant — Negativicoccus succi-
nicivorans,
the novel class of Negativicutes and novel
order of Selenomonadales were introduced to accommo-
date the Gram-negative staining bacteria within the Fir-
micutes phylum (Marchandin et al., 2010). The ﬁrst
record of this bacterial group dates from 1898 when Veil-
lon and Zuber isolated Staphylococcus parvulus, which was
later
from infected
appendix tissue (Veillon & Zuber, 1898). The Negativi-
cutes are typically isolated from the oral cavity or the
proximal small bowel (Rogosa, 1965; Simon & Gorbach,
1986), but representative species from this group can be
detected in high abundances even in the lower intestinal
tract. In that line V. parvula, can reach densities of up to
1011 cells g

showed that these bacteria represent more than 2% of the
total
fecal microbiota in some subjects (Paliy et al.,
2009). Members of the Negativicutes are assacharolytic
and utilize end=products of sugar metabolisms of other
gastrointestinal bacteria (such as lactate or succinate) to
produce propionate, forming an important trophic chain.
Propionate is a beneﬁcial product of the gastrointestinal
microbiota as it has anti-inﬂammatory potential, is uti-
lized by adipose tissue and the liver, plays a role in the
satiety sensation, inﬂuences glucose and energy homeosta-
sis, and improves insulin sensitivity (Vipperla & O’Keefe,
2012; De Vadder et al., 2014). In the upper gastrointesti-
nal tract, Veillonella spp. are an indispensable component
of the gastrointestinal microbiota (van den Bogert et al.,
2011) where they form a trophic chain with the lactate
and acetate-producing Streptococcus spp. (Zoetendal et al.,
2012). Currently, there is no evidence about the role of
Veillonella spp. in human health, although several studies
have shown an increased abundance of Veillonella spp. in
fecal samples of irritable bowel patients (Malinen et al.,
2005; Tana et al., 2010; Saulnier et al., 2011), which could
indicate an increased transit of the ileal microbiota to the
lower part of the gastrointestinal tract..

ria that based on their SSU rRNA gene sequence cluster
within the Erysipelotrichi class are still ofﬁcially classiﬁed
within other groups of the Firmicutes . This indi-
cates that a major revision of this group can be expected
in the future. There are several studies that link Erysipelo-
trichi with compromised health. An increased abundance
of Erysipelotrichi in patients suffering from colon cancer
was reported (Chen et al., 2012). Animal model experi-
this group are
ments have shown that members of
increased on high fat, and western type diets (Turnbaugh
et al., 2009; Fleissner et al., 2010), while their increased
abundance is associated with obesity (Turnbaugh et al.,
2006). Furthermore, it has been shown that an increased
abundance of Erysipelotrichaceae correlates with choline
deﬁciency-induced fatty liver disease
et al.,
2011), which causes multiple organ dysfunctions. Choline
is an important component of our diet, and recently, it
was found that choline and phospatidylcholine are con-
verted by the intestinal microbiota to trimethylamine,
which is further metabolized to proatherogenic trimethyl-
amine-N-oxide, linking diet and microbiota to cardiovas-
cular disease (Wang et al., 2011b; Koeth et al., 2013)..

It has been suggested that members of the Tenericutes
are involved in inﬂammatory bowel disease, as they have
the ability to adhere to and to fuse with epithelial and
immune system cells, which could explain intracellular
epithelial structures in the Crohn’s disease patients’ biop-
sies detected by electron microscopy (Roediger & Macfar-
lane, 2002). A molecular survey has revealed that a
cultured representative of this group — the pathogenic
Mycoplasma pneumoniae — can be detected in mucosal
biopsies of both inﬂammatory bowel disease patients and
healthy controls alike, although Crohn’s disease patients
had a signiﬁcantly higher abundance of this bacterium
than ulcerative colitis patients and healthy subjects (Chen
et al., 2001). The ﬁrst report of the Mycoplasma in the
human gastrointestinal tract dates from 1973 (Bhat et al.,
1973), while speciﬁc searches for Ureaplasma urealyticum
and Mycoplasma hominis revealed the presence of these
two species in anal swaps of more than half of the ana-
lyzed subjects (Munday et al., 1981)..

ria are pointed, nonsporulating, Gram-negative, anaerobic
bacilli (Knorr, 1922). The ﬁrst record of a Fusobacterium
spp. originates from 1886 when Bacillus fusiforme (now
known as Fusobacterium necrophorum) was reported as a
pathogen related to appendicitis (Fl€ugge, 1886). Although
Fusobacterium spp. can be isolated from gastrointestinal
samples of healthy humans
in densities of up to
(cid:1)1 of feces (Benno et al., 1989), this group of
1010 cells g
bacteria seems to be relevant for intestinal inﬂammation.
Recent studies have shown that the majority of cases of
acute appendicitis are associated with a local infection of
Fusobacterium spp. (Swidsinski et al., 2011), while the
increased abundance of Fusobacterium spp. is associated
with ulcerative colitis (Rajili(cid:1)c-Stojanovi(cid:1)c et al., 2013a)
and colorectal cancer (Castellarin et al., 2012; Kostic
et al., 2012). The human gastrointestinal tract-associated
Fusobacteria also include representatives of the Leptotri-
chia genus and the misclassiﬁed C. rectum ..

Fusobacteria are

another phylum of
detected gastrointestinal bacteria, the majority of which
belong to the genus Fusobacterium . These bacte-.

20th century (Holdeman et al., 1976; Benno et al., 1986;
Moore & Moore, 1995; Macfarlane et al., 2004). Ironi-
cally, the recent SSU rRNA gene sequence analysis of
G. formicilis indicated that this species has been misclassi-
ﬁed and belongs to Firmicutes (Clostridia/Clostridiales/
Ruminococcaceae) and has almost an identical SSU rRNA
gene
(98.3%
sequence similarity). Nevertheless, other representatives of
the true Alphaproteobacteria seem to be a part of the
normal gastrointestinal microbiota. In a recent study, four
alphaproteobacterial species were cultivated from gastro-
et al., 2012a). Twenty-four

samples
subdivision were detected by
other members of
retrieving SSU rRNA gene sequences identical to previ-
ously cultured bacteria from gastrointestinal
samples
. AlphapProteobacteria seem to be char-
acteristic for the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract as
sequences of these bacteria were detected only in studies
where samples from the upper intestine were included
(Eckburg et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2005), or when the
microbiota of patients with ileal pouch was analyzed
(McLaughlin et al., 2010). There are no data that corre-
late Alphaproteobacteria with any speciﬁc function in the
gastrointestinal
some
genera are known to perform speciﬁc metabolic transfor-
mations — for example, Methylobacterium spp. include
bacteria that can oxidize methylamine or methanol to.

The ﬁrst bacterium from the Betaproteobacteria class —
Alcaligenes faecalis — was isolated from a human fecal
sample in 1896 (Petruschky, 1896). This asaccharolytic
rod that can utilize urea, a range of amino-acids, and can

quently been detected in later studies of the gastrointesti-
nal microbiota. A number of other bacteria within this
class have been detected in recent years, showing that
Betaproteobacteria are diverse and ubiquitous members of
the gastrointestinal microbiota . Among them,
Sutterella and Parrasutterella are the most
frequently
encountered and the abundant gastrointestinal microor-
ganisms (Nagai et al., 2009; Mukhopadhya et al., 2011).
These bacteria are typical for the gastrointestinal microbi-
ota ecosystem, assacharolytic and inactive in classical
microbiological
tests. Their abundance is increased in
autistic children (Williams et al., 2012) and in patients
suffering from type 2 diabetes (Larsen et al., 2010).
Hence, it is of interest to deﬁne which metabolic transfor-
mations are catalyzed by these bacteria, as they might be
particularly relevant for understanding the global impact
of the gastrointestinal microbiota on human health. Alca-
ligenes faecalis and related bacteria are common gastroin-
testinal tract inhabitants, notably of the ileum. Alcaligenes
spp. may be opportunists that inhabit Peyers’ patches and
signal to the immune system as shown in model animals
(Obata et al., 2010). Moreover, Alcaligenes spp. produce
NO, which is an important biological regulator (Culotta
& Koshland, 1992; Anderson et al., 1993)..

intestinal
inhabitant. It has been isolated in 1985 and described as a
unique intestinal bacterium that degrades exclusively oxa-
(cid:1)1 of feces
late and can reach densities of up to 107 cells g
(Allison et al., 1985). Due to its metabolic activity, O. for-.

Neisseria spp. are inhabiting mucosal surfaces of the gen-
ital, the respiratory and the upper gastrointestinal tract.
Neisseria gonorhhoea and Neisseria meningitis are the most
studied as they are important pathogens causing gonor-
rhoea and meningitis. However, the majority of Neisseria
spp. are nonpathogenic and their presence in the gastroin-
testinal tract samples was detected in the early cultivation-
based studies (Gray & Shiner, 1967; Bhat et al., 1980). The
presence of speciﬁc Neisseria spp. in the gastrointestinal
tract was only recently reported in a high-throughput cul-
turing study (Lagier et al., 2012a) and emerged from SSU
rRNA gene sequencing-based studies .
Nonpathogenic Neisseria spp. do not catabolize many car-
bohydrates, while some species are even asaccharolytic, but
they can reduce nitrate. It is known that Neisseria spp. are
able to grow on amino acids and can use sulfur directly
from sulfate (McDonald & Johnson, 1975), but their func-
tion in the gastrointestinal tract has not been exploited..

which are occasionally reported as members of the gastro-
intestinal microbiota . Among them, Acidovorax
spp. were found to be ubiquitously present in the colonic
mucosa (Hong et al., 2011), Burkholderia spp. were found
in an increased abundance in hepatic encephalopathy and
were linked to poor cognition and inﬂammation (Bajaj
et al., 2012), while Variovorax spp. seem to be particularly
abundant

Bogert et al., 2011). There is no available information
about association of other species with speciﬁc gastroin-
testinal sites, diseases or functions of the gastrointestinal
microbiota..

Within the class Gammaproteobacteria, nine different fam-
ilies distributed within six different orders have been
detected in the human gastrointestinal samples. Escherichia
coli was the ﬁrst bacterial isolate of the Gammaproteobac-
teria characterized from human gastrointestinal samples in
1885 (Shulman et al., 2007). Escherichia coli belongs to the
Enterobacteriaceae family, which is the most diverse, pre-
valent and abundant of all gastrointestinal Proteobacteria
. Most of Enterobacteriaceae members are associ-
ated with diarrhea (Thielman & Guerrant, 2004), although
representatives of this family are not necessarily causing
any symptoms and are actually one of the ﬁrst to be found
in the newborn gastrointestinal tract (Favier et al., 2002).
The abundance of this bacterial group increases with age,
but it remains subdominant and in elderly subjects repre-
sents about 1% of the total gastrointestinal microbiota
(Hopkins et al., 2001). Escherichia coli is the most preva-
lent representative of this family that is often the most
abundant facultative anaerobe in the gastrointestinal sam-
ples. The different strains of E. coli can exhibit different
properties, varying from probiotic (Kruis et al., 2004) to
pathogenic causing diarrhea or infections on other sites
(Ron, 2006). The majority of other Enterobacteriaceae spp.
are infrequently isolated from gastrointestinal samples
(Bucher & von Graevenitz, 1982; M€uller, 1986). In that
line, a study of dedicated isolation of the Morganella-
Proteus-Providencia group from feces of almost 3000
healthy subjects and patients suffering from enteric dis-
eases, showed that species of this group are subabundant
and have joined prevalence between 10% and 20%,
depending on the health status (M€uller, 1986). Still, the
the most comprehensively
Enterobacteriaceae is one of
described gastrointestinal families, which can be explained
by its development as a paradigm for genetic studies and
its clinical relevance (Grimont et al., 1981; Hickman-Bren-
ner et al., 1984; Farmer et al., 1985; Hickman-Brenner
et al., 1985a, b). A speciﬁc case is represented by the
so-called adherent-invasive E. coli strains that have been.

implied in various forms of inﬂammation in the gastroin-
testinal tract of human and animal models (Negroni et al.,
2012; Chassaing et al., 2014). Phylogenetically, the Entero-
bacteriaceae is a diverse group and while some genera
form separate clusters (e.g., Yersinia), species of other
genera are mixed up in the SSU rRNA phylogenetic tree
. The absence of genus-speciﬁc SSU rRNA gene
sequences for these genera, could explain a recent the
sequences assigned to E. coli, Salmonella
ﬁnding that
enterica, Citrobacter koseri, and Enterobacter cancerogenus
appear together (Lozupone et al., 2012)..

In addition to the Enterobacteriaceae, representatives of
eight other bacterial families with the Gammaproteobac-
teria class can be detected in the human gastrointestinal
tract . Among these, members of the Moraxella-
ceae are relatively frequently detected using both cultiva-
tion-based and molecular studies. Within this family,
Acinetobacter spp. are the most diverse and are frequently
detected in infants (Chang et al., 2011; Pandey et al.,
2012), with an increased abundance in infants
that
develop allergy (Nakayama et al., 2011). A recent study
has indicated that members of the Gammaproteobacteria
and in particular Haemophilus spp. are elevated in irrita-
ble bowel syndrome pediatric patients (Saulnier et al.,
2011). Members of the same phylogenetic group were
found to correlate with irritable bowel syndrome symp-
tom score in an independent study (Rajili(cid:1)c-Stojanovi(cid:1)c
et al., 2011). Haemophilus spp. are relatively frequently
detected in the upper parts of the gastrointestinal tract of
healthy humans of different ages (Justesen et al., 1984;
Ou et al., 2009), but also can be detected inﬂamed and
stool specimens from children with diarrhea, with rela-
tively low prevalence (M(cid:1)egraud et al., 1988)..

Aeromonas spp. are medically signiﬁcant as these spe-
cies are implicated in the development of the gastroenter-
itis and diarrhea. The role of these bacteria in human
health has been a subject of a long-lasting debate result-
ing in a conclusion that at least four gastrointestinal spe-
cies (A. caviae, A. hydrophila, A. jandaei, and A. veronii),
are pathogenic (Janda & Abbott, 1998). The presence of
these species in the gastrointestinal tract is not necessarily
inducing any symptoms, although in vitro experiments
have indicated that they are cytotoxic and induce lesions
in the intestinal mucosa (Pitarangsi et al., 1982)..

The Succinivibrionaceae family groups strictly anaerobic
bacteria that ferment carbohydrates to produce succinate
and acetate. Representatives of three genera of this family
can be detected in the human gastrointestinal tract: An-
aerobiospirillum spp. are motile, spiral bacteria that are
implicated in the development of diarrhea (Malnick,
1997); while Succinatimonas and Succinivibrio representa-
tives are subdominant bacteria that were isolated from
healthy humans (Table S1)..

Members of the Vibrionaceae are pathogens that cause
acute, self-limiting gastroenteritis (Hou et al., 2011). The
natural habitat of Vibrio spp. is the aquatic ecosystem,
and hence they are only rarely detected in the human.

Eight different Pseudomonas spp. can be detected in the
human gastrointestinal tract. Among them, Pseudomonas
frequently
aeruginosa is
reported as a member of the fecal microbiota of healthy
humans
(Finegold et al., 1974; Benno et al., 1986).
Although a member of the normal gastrointestinal micro-
biota, Pseudomonas aeruginosa can act as an opportunistic
pathogen in critically ill or immuno-suppressed patients
and cause sepsis as it can interact with our immune sys-
tem (Wu et al., 2005) and can disrupt the intestinal epi-
et al., 2006). Pseudomonas
thelial barrier
ﬂuorescens is a less prevalent member of the genus that
has been implicated in the development of Crohn’s dis-
ease (Wei et al., 2002). A recent study showed that Pseu-
domonas spp., among other Proteobacteria, have increased
abundance in infants with colic (de Weerth et al., 2013)..

Until today, only two bacteria from Xanthomonadaceae
have
samples:
Stenotrophomonas maltophilia from a stool and an ileal
sample derived from atypical clinical cases (Tamura et al.,
1988; Apisarnthanarak et al., 2003), and Lysobacter soli in
a recent high-throughput cultivation of the normal gas-
trointestinal microbiota (Lagier et al., 2012a). In addition,
four other related bacterial species were detected based
on the SSU rRNA gene sequence. These bacteria were
previously isolated from different ecosystems and include
Nevskia ramose
ginsenosidimutans
and Rhodanobacter
from soil, Pseudoxanthomonas mexicana from sludge and
urine, and Silanimonas lenta from a hot spring. Based on
their low prevalence in the gastrointestinal tract,
it is
most likely that Xanthomonadaceae are transient members
of the gastrointestinal microbiota..

Sulfate-reducing bacteria that cluster within the d class of
the phylum Proteobacteria inhabit the human gastrointes-
tinal
tract where they utilize sulfate that can be diet
derived or released from mucins. Human gastrointestinal
tract-associated sulfate-reducing bacteria include the ace-
tate-utilizing Desulfobacter spp., the lactate-, and H2-uti-
lizing Desulfovibrio spp., and the propionate-utilizing
Desulfobulbus spp. (Gibson et al., 1988). This group of
related bacteria has been subject of numerous studies
because the end-product of their metabolism — hydrogen
sulﬁde — is a highly toxic compound that inhibits buty-
rate oxidation within the colonocytes
(Attene-Ramos
et al., 2006). Hydrogen sulﬁde overproduction in the gas-
trointestinal tract has been linked to ulcerative colitis and
colon cancer. Although some cultivation, studies showed
an association between the presence of sulfate-reducing.

the overproduction of

involved in compromised health, at least in healthy sub-
jects. Sulfate-reducing bacteria are normally present in

low abundance, of approximately 106–107 cells g

bacter and Helicobacter. Campylobacter is a genus that
groups diverse isolates from mucosal surfaces of gastroin-
testinal, oral and urogenital tract. The ﬁrst report of Cam-
pylobacter isolation from the human gastrointestinal tract
dates from 1946 (Levy, 1946). Campylobacter spp. were
originally described as members of genus Vibrio, and
reclassiﬁed into an independent genus in 1973 (Veron &
Chatelain, 1973). Species of this genus are principally con-
sidered to be pathogenic organisms involved in diarrheal
illness. However, Campylobacter hominis has been isolated
from a gastrointestinal sample of a healthy subject (Lawson
et al., 2001), while C. concisus is a clinical isolate that also
has been recovered from healthy individual (Engberg et al.,
2000). Finally, a recent study of the microaerophilic fecal
microbiota of children revealed diverse and prevalent colo-
nization of Campylobacter spp. of gastrointestinal tract of
both healthy and children suffering from inﬂammatory
bowel diseases (Hansen et al., 2013). The presence of Cam-
pylobacter spp. in the gastrointestinal tract can cause watery
or bloody diarrhea, whereas it also can be associated with
intestinal diseases such as ulcerative colitis (Rajili(cid:1)c-Stojano-
vi(cid:1)c et al., 2013a). However, Campylobacter spp. can also
remain asymptomatic, suggesting that at least some species
of this genus are commercial members of the gastrointesti-
nal microbiota..

The Arcobacter genus was introduced to accommodate
an independent cluster identiﬁed based on the SSU rRNA.

gene sequences, of species that were previously classiﬁed
within the Campylobacter genus (Vandamme et al., 1991).
These bacteria are also associated with diarrheal disease,
although the prevalence of their isolation, even from clin-
ical samples is very low (Engberg et al., 2000)..

The genus Helicobacter has been derived from Cam-
pylobacter after reclassiﬁcation of
the latter (Goodwin
et al., 1989; Vandamme et al., 1991). Helicobacter spp. are
spiral-shaped bacteria that were detected in human gastric
mucosa as late as in 1906 (Krienitz, 1906). They received
exceptional attention once Helicobacter pylori was discov-
ered to induce the gastric and duodenal ulcers (for recent
review see, Fock et al., 2013). Helicobacter spp. are mainly
located in the stomach but can be detected in the other
gastrointestinal samples of healthy individuals but only
when highly sensitive techniques are applied, suggesting
that they may lyse and disappear in transit from the
stomach (MacKay et al., 2003; Ceelen et al., 2005).
Hence, their prevalence is low in samples from the lower
gastrointestinal tract (Hansen et al., 2013)..

Victivallis vadensis is the only species within the phylum
of Lentisphaerae that has been isolated from the gastroin-
testinal tract . This species was isolated in 2003,
liquid
as a bacterium that was able to grow in basal.

The ﬁrst report of the Spirochetes in the human gastrointes-
tinal samples dates from 1923 when a cultivation-based
study reported the 28% prevalence of these bacteria in fecal
samples of healthy individuals (Parr, 1923). The Spirochetes
are established pathogens in veterinary medicine and their
pathogenicity in humans has been debated for a long per-
iod of time. Two species of the phylum Spirochetes can be
detected in the human gastrointestinal samples: Brachyspira
pilosicoli and Brachyspira aalborgi . Their presence
in the gastrointestinal tract is termed intestinal spirochet-
osis, which in clinical cases is associated with abdominal
pain and diarrhea. However, a retrospective review of cases
diagnosed as intestinal spirochetosis revealed that the pres-
ence of Spirochetes in the gastrointestinal biopsies is often
asymptomatic and may not have pathological signiﬁcance
(Carr et al., 2010). The question of implication of the Spi-
rochetes in clinical cases might be a question of their density
in the gut. These bacteria typically colonize intestinal
mucosa where they attach and penetrate short distances
into the surface epithelial cells (Harland & Lee, 1967). In
clinical cases of spirochetosis they form a dense bioﬁlm that
covers the entire colonic surface, as indicated by scanning.

electron microscopy images (Gad et al., 1977). Another
factor might be relevant to the currently undeﬁned role of
the Spirochetes in human health. A recent molecular study
showed that
in addition to the two cultured species,
another, currently uncultured Brachyspira spp. is more fre-
quent than the other two Brachyspira spp. in the human
colonic biopsies. Although this
study conﬁrmed the
absence of a correlation between these species and physical
complaints, it appeared that B. pilosicoli is associated with
intestinal inﬂammation (Westerman et al., 2012)..

0.01% in human fecal samples (Horz et al., 2006). The ﬁrst
attempt to detect this group of bacteria in the human gas-
trointestinal tract yielded a sole SSU rRNA gene sequence
that is identical to that of a later on cultured Cloacibacillus
evryensis (Ganesan et al., 2008). Cloacibacillus spp. are
amino acid degrading bacteria that use sulfate as terminal
electron acceptor and that are capable to use mucin as sole
carbon source (Looft et al., 2013). Their presence in the
human gastrointestinal microbiota was conﬁrmed by

gastrointestinal Synergistetes bacterium — Pyramidobacter
piscolens (Lagier et al., 2012a). Pyramidobacter piscolens was
described in 2009, as an asaccharolytic, anaerobic oral
isolate capable of hydrogen sulﬁde production..

Currently, only two species within the Verrucomicrbia
phylum have been detected in the human gastrointestinal
tract. Akkermansia muciniphila was described in 2004 as a
unique human gastrointestinal bacterium that is able to
grow on intestinal mucus as a sole carbon source (Derri-
en et al., 2004). This bacterium is widely distributed and
can be detected in fecal material of humans of all age
groups (Collado et al., 2007), and although its abundance
varies between subjects, it is probably one of the members

decreased abundance is associated with compromised
health including acute appendicitis
(Swidsinski et al.,
2011), ulcerative colitis (Vigsnæs et al., 2012; Rajili(cid:1)c-
Stojanovi(cid:1)c et al., 2013a), autism (Wang et al., 2011a),
and atopic diseases (Candela et al., 2012). Finally, the
abundance of A. muciniphila is inversely correlated with
obesity (Karlsson et al., 2012). A recent study suggests
that A. muciniphila plays a pivotal role in obesity as its
duodenal delivery regulates
fat-mass gain, metabolic
endotoxemia, adipose tissue inﬂammation, and insulin
resistance in an animal model experiment (Everard et al.,
2013). Given the very short history of the research related
to A. muciniphila, the wealth of data that support its

importance of this bacterium. In addition, one other spe-
cies of the Verrucomicrobia — Prosthecobacter ﬂuviatilis —
has been detected in the study of bacteria of a patient
with ileal pouch (McLaughlin et al.,
2010), while
sequences classiﬁed within this genus were detected in the
study of the microbiota of infants (Palmer et al., 2007)..

There are a few gastrointestinal bacterial phyla with low
diversity that have not yet been discussed, including the
Deinococcus-Thermus bacteria,
the Melainabacteria the
Gemmatimonadetes and the Planctomycetes . The
Deinococcus-Thermus bacteria were for the ﬁrst time asso-
ciated with the human gastrointestinal microbiota in
2006, when uncultured phylotypes within this phylum
were recovered in a molecular survey of the microbiota of
the human stomach (Bik et al., 2006). Several studies
have conﬁrmed the presence of these bacteria in the gas-
trointestinal microbiota, while a recent high-throughput
culturing study detected a single cultivated bacterium of
this phylum (Lagier et al., 2012a). Currently, no particu-
lar function has been assigned to this bacterial group,
although there is evidence that these bacteria are active in
the distal parts of the gastrointestinal tract (Peris-Bondia
et al., 2011).
Molecular.

In addition to the bacterial phyla that are reproducibly
detected by many studies of the human gastrointestinal
microbiota, some bacterial phyla are only occasionally
found. For instance, some studies have reported the pres-
ence of the Gemmatimonadetes in the human gastrointes-
(Andersson et al., 2008), but even when
tinal
present, these bacteria constitute an extremely minor frac-
tion, as indicated by the fact that only one of over 15 000
SSU rRNA gene sequences in the study of the microbiota
of inﬂammatory bowel disease patients and controls orig-
inated from a Gemmatimonadetes bacterium (Frank et al.,
2007). Furthermore, a few pyrosequencing studies have
reported Nitrospira bacteria in the human gastrointestinal
tract (Hung et al., 2011). It is interesting to note that in
a recent study of the microbiota of pediatric irritable
bowel syndrome patients only one Nitrospira phylotype
was detected by pyrosequencing. However, the further
attempts to retrieve this bacterium revealed that
the
detected sequence was actually retrieved from a novel
taxon related to the genus Ruminococcus (Saulnier et al.,
2011). This example testiﬁes to the fact that identiﬁcation
of sequences based on very short reads, such as those
produced by currently used high-throughput sequencing
technologies, are not always reliable (Werner et al., 2012).
The presence of the Planctomycetes in the human gas-
trointestinal tract was reported only in molecular-based
studies (Wilson & Blitchington, 1996; De Filippo et al.,
2010; Hong et al., 2011). A sequence of an uncultured
bacterium (Gene Bank Accession Number U58225) was
reported in one of
the
human gastrointestinal microbiota, and was designated as
an uncultured Plantomycetes bacterium (Wilson & Blitch-
ington, 1996). However, the detected SSU rRNA gene
sequence was probably retrieved from a representative of
a new genus within the Lentisphaerae phylum, since it has
the highest similarity with V. vadensis (that was
isolated and described after publication of the molecular
study). Nevertheless, Plantomycetes might be a part of the
human gastrointestinal microbiota, as a recent review
indicated the detection of a diverse community of the
Planctomycetes in the human gastrointestinal tract (Lagier
et al., 2012b). When analyzing the publicly available data,
we found that only one (JQ287572) had high similarity
to the SSU rRNA gene sequence of a cultured bac-
terium—Schlesneria paludicola. However, based on the
it grows in the
characteristics of this bacterium (e.g.,.

Bacteria are the dominant but not an exclusive compo-
nent of the human gastrointestinal microbiota. Archaea,
primarily the methanogenic ones, can be relatively abun-
dant component of the gastrointestinal microbiota with
densities of up to 1010 cells g
feces (Bond et al.,
1971; Miller & Wolin, 1986). In total, eight archaeal spe-
cies have been associated with the human gastrointestinal
tract . In an early cultivation study,
which dates from 1968, a single methanogenic species,
isolated from four of ﬁve individuals, was identiﬁed as
Methanobrevibacter ruminantium (Nottingham & Hun-
gate, 1968). Today, Methanobrevibacter smithii is recog-
nized as the most abundant, and often an exclusive
methanogen of human gastrointestinal microbiota (Miller
& Wolin, 1986; Dridi et al., 2009), which suggests a pos-
sible misidentiﬁcation of the isolates in the earlier study.
In addition to M. smithii, Methanosphaera stadtmaniae is
a relatively prevalent, but atypical methanogenic archaea
that reduces methanol and that can be found in human
feces in low concentrations (Miller & Wolin, 1985; Dridi
et al., 2009). Similar to M. stadtmaniae, a recently iso-
lated Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis can also utilize
methanol in the presence of hydrogen, but these two gas-
trointestinal archaeal species are phylogenetically distant
(Dridi et al., 2012). Methanogenic archaea have been
extensively studied as the process of methane synthesis
from carbon dioxide and hydrogen results in a signiﬁcant
gas removal
tract. The role of
methanogenic archaea might be particularly relevant for
bloating, which is one of the symptoms of irritable bowel
syndrome, and a recent study has shown a highly signiﬁ-
cant (fourfold) reduction of methanogenic archaea in irri-
to controls
table bowel
(Rajili(cid:1)c-Stojanovi(cid:1)c et al., 2011). In addition to methano-
genic archaea, two cultured species of halophilic archaea
have been detected in the study of the microbiota of Kor-
ean subjects (Nam et al., 2008), while the presence of low
numbers of these organisms was conﬁrmed by the analy-
sis of the colonic mucosa of inﬂammatory bowel patients
(Oxley et al., 2010). In addition to the conﬁrmed pres-
ence of the Euryarchaeota phylum members, the human
gastrointestinal archaea might also include a number of
yet uncultured species within the Thermoplasma and the
Crenarchaeota phylum and putative novel orders, as
detected in molecular-based studies and recently reviewed
(Dridi et al., 2011). The presence of Crenarchaeota phy-
lum representatives was detected by retrieving the speciﬁc
partial SSU rRNA gene sequences in a study that dates.

from 2005 (Rieu-Lesme et al., 2005). One of the ampli-
ﬁed SSU rRNA gene sequences (AY887079) shows 97%
sequence similarity with SSU rRNA gene sequence of
Sulfolobus
(AY887074) 99%
sequence similarity with the SSU rRNA gene of Candida-
tus Nitrososphaera gargensis. It should be noted that both
Sulfolobus solfataricus and Nitrososphaera gargensis are hy-
perthermophilic species, and it
is highly unlikely that
these species inhabit the gastrointestinal tract of humans.
Until cultured representatives or at least the full SSU
rRNA gene sequences of the Crenarchaeota species are
obtained in the future independent studies, the presence
of the this archaeal phylum in the human gastrointestinal
tract remains questionable..

infections, primarily
the
gastrointestinal tract. All Apicomplexa species that can be
retrieved from the human gastrointestinal tract are con-
sidered to be pathogenic (Farthing, 2006). Cryptosporidi-
um parvum is the most widely distributed representative
of the group, and it has a high prevalence of infection in
children of the developing world (Checkley et al., 1997).
Although infections with Cryptosporidium parvum can be
asymptomatic, even when it does not cause diarrhea, this
organism affects absorption of nutrients and has a nega-
tive effect on weight gain of children (Checkley et al.,
1997)..

Blastocystis spp. (classiﬁed within the Stramenopiles) are
single-celled protozoan organisms. Blastocystis spp. was
for the ﬁrst time isolated from the human gastrointestinal
tract in 1911 and was reported under name Blastocystis
enterocola, which was, at the time, designated as yeast
(Alexieff, 1911). According to the current convention, all
Blastocystis isolated from humans are identiﬁed as Blasto-
cystis hominis, although their SSU rRNA gene sequence
analysis showed that nine different phylotypes of these
organisms can be detected in the human gastrointestinal
tract (Arisue et al., 2003; Scanlan & Marchesi, 2008). This
‘within species’ diversity of the B. hominis can explain the
fact that the role of Blastocystis in human disease is still
not deﬁned (Zierdt, 1991). Longitudinal study of
the
Eukarya in the human gastrointestinal tract has shown
that Blastocystis spp. are stable and frequently detected
organisms
(Scanlan & Marchesi,
2008). Although some authors have suggested the link.

is the only representative of the
Ciliophora phylum. Neobalantidium coli is the largest pro-
tozoan parasite that infects humans, but its natural hosts
are pigs. Although the organism can reproduce within the
intestinal lumen of humans without attacking the tissues
and therefore remain asymptomatic, the infection with
this species is typically followed by diarrhea and bloody
stools (Katz et al., 1982)..

(Saklatvala, 1993). There are several studies that show the
successful detection of Entamoeba spp. in clinical samples
using molecular methods, typically in stool samples taken
from patients with diarrhea. Molecular studies of the Euk-
arya as part of the ecosystem in the human gastrointestinal
tract already conﬁrmed the presence of two Entamoeba spe-
cies: Entamoeba coli (Scanlan & Marchesi, 2008) and Ent-
amoeba
the
gastrointestinal tract of a healthy man..

Members of the phyla Micosporidia, Parabasalia and
Metamonada are micro-eukaryotic organisms that contain
ﬂagella and are often commonly termed as ﬂagellates.
Micosporidia are obligate intracellular protozoan parasites
that spread in the environment via spores. Four species
of Micosporidia can infect the human gastrointestinal tract
— Enterocytozoon bieneusi (Desportes et al., 1985), En-
cephalitozoon intestinalis (Weber et al., 1994), Encephalito-
zoon cuniculi (Franzen et al., 1995), and Retortamonas
intestinalis (Jones-Engel et al., 2004; Fig. 28, Table S3).
for which SSU rRNA gene
Retortamonas
sequence is not available,

time cultured in 1879
group that was
(Hogue, 1933). Other Micosporidia were isolated from the
gastrointestinal tract of a subject infected with HIV (Des-
portes et al., 1985). The presence of Micosporidia in the
gastrointestinal tract is typically associated with diarrhea,
mostly in immuno-suppressed patients, although spores
of these organisms can be detected in gastrointestinal
samples of asymptomatic subjects (Cegielski et al., 1999;
Mungthin et al., 2005; Wichro et al., 2005). If asymptom-
atic, the presence of Micosporidia in the gastrointestinal
tract is associated with malnutrition..

two species can be associated
with the human gastrointestinal tract. Pentatrichomonas
hominis is generally regarded as a harmless commensal
organism, although it
is occasionally designated as a
causal agent of diarrhea. This organism, which actually
represents the oldest gastrointestinal isolate retrieved in
1854, has a low prevalence of the human gastrointestinal

location (Honigberg,
1990). In 1918 another member of this group, Dient-
in the
amoeba fragilis was reported as a commensal

latter
the
research has suggested that D. fragilis might be associ-
ated with a number of diseases
including diarrhea,
irritable bowel syndrome or
abdominal pain, anorexia,
allergic colitis (reviewed in Johnson et al., 2004). The
uncertainty of the pathogenicity of D. fragilis might be,
similar to B. hominis, due to the presence of different
phylotypes, since two different phylotypes of this species,
with 2% SSU rRNA gene sequence divergence, have
been identiﬁed (Johnson & Clark, 2000)..

The Metamonada phylum includes Giardia lamblia
and two rarely detected and principally nonpathogenic
species — Enteromonas homins and R. intestinalis (Katz
et al., 1982). Giardia lamblia is the most common ﬂagel-
late of the human gastrointestinal tract. When ingested,
typically via contaminated food or water, G. lamblia
attaches to the mucosal surface of
the duodenum or
jejunum and multiplies by binary ﬁssion (Wolfe, 1992).
and
Infection with G. lamblia is
although it may remain asymptomatic, giardiasis can be
followed by a range of symptoms that include steator-
rhoea, diarrhea and weight loss (Wolfe, 1992). It is not
clear why some infections are asymptomatic, but already
in the 1970s, it was suggested that the symptoms might
depend on the relation between the parasite and the
enteric gastrointestinal microbiota (Tandon et al., 1977).
Postinfective to the giardiasis, patients might develop a
range of novel symptoms that resemble those of the irri-
table bowel syndrome (Hanevik et al., 2009). This con-
infection with

other infectious agents, such as Campylobacter spp.,

the bacterial fraction of the gastrointestinal microbiota
of the postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome patients
have a distinct composition relative to controls, which
most likely reﬂects a consequence of an intensive inter-
action between the ecosystem and the infectious agent
(Jalanka-Tuovinen et al., 2013). This

trointestinal microbiota should be kept in mind when
studying the gastrointestinal microbiota, as their short-
and long-term impact on the microbiota composition
and function can be profound.
