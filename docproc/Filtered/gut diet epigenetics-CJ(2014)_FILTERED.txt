Glucosinolates are converted into isothiocyanates (ITC) by either the plant myrosinases, or 
bacterially produced thioglucosidases. Cooking cruciferous vegetables deactivates the plant 
myrosinases, and given that most cruciferous vegetables consumed by humans are cooked, 
gut bacteria play a critical role in converting glucosinolates to ITC. Previous studies have 
shown that certain species of bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Bacteroides 
thetaiotaomicron, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Peptostreptococcus sp. and .

Colon cancer is associated with a high-fat diet in western populations and rates in non-
western populations are increasing as a more western, non-traditional diet is adopted.98, 99 
Recent studies in mice suggest that the gut microbiome influences the size and composition 
of the bile acid pool throughout the enterohepatic system and exposure may influence cancer 
risk.100 For example, R. gnavus can convert 7-oxo-lithocholic acid to UDCA.101 A study of 
the microbiome in colorectal and healthy subjects found a 63% increase in the amount of 
UDCA in stools of healthy individuals correlated with Ruminococcus sp.102 Secondary bile 
acids, deoxychloate (DCA), lithodeoxycholate (LDA), and ursodeoxycholate (UDCA) 
increase in response to high fat diets and are increased in populations with higher incidence 
of colorectal cancers. In particular, there was a positive association with DCA and colorectal 
adenomas, a precursor to colorectal cancer.103-109 In contrast, UDCA has been shown in 
animal and in vitro studies to reduce the risk of cancer dysplasia and cancer 
development110, 111 and, in a phase III clinical trial, UDCAs reduced the degree of dysplasia 
in colonic polyps.,112 Recent mechanistic studies suggest that, in contrast to butyrate, 
UDCA induced cell differentiation and senescence in colon cancer cells via histone 
hypoacetylation.113
