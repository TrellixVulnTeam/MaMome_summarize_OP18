The microbiological diagnosis of a ‘normal’ or dis-
turbed vaginal microbiota has historically been based on
the Nugent score, the current gold standard diagnostic
method that relies on Gram stain of vaginal smears 
The ‘normal’ vaginal microbiota in non-pregnant repro-
ductive aged women is understood to be dominated by
Lactobacillus species, while an abnormal microbiota
(defined as bacterial vaginosis) is characterized by low
abundance of lactobacilli and an overgrowth of anaer-
obic bacteria, such as Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella
spp., Bacteroides spp., Mobiluncus spp. and Mycoplasma
hominis  In low-risk pregnant women, it has been
shown that the vaginal microbiota has reduced richness
lactobacilli
and diversity and increased abundance of
compared to those of non-pregnant women  An
abnormal microbiota has been previously associated
with preterm birth  but only a few in depth
culture-independent studies of the vaginal microbiota of
women who had preterm birth have been published,
with inconsistent conclusions .

The objective of this study was to assess whether there
are differences in the vaginal microbiota composition,
early in gestation, of women who had spontaneous pre-
term birth (sPTB) and term delivery that could be fur-
ther investigated as diagnostic indicators of preterm
birth risk. Microbiome profiling was based on sequen-
cing of the cpn60 universal target, which provides higher
resolution than 16S rRNA variable regions and al-
lows the resolution of Gardnerella vaginalis subgroups,
a hallmark bacteria in the disturbed microbiota .

Conventional PCR
Some Mollicutes (Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma) species
lack a cpn60 gene  Thus, we performed a family-
specific semi-nested PCR targeting the 16S rRNA gene
to detect Mollicutes  and a PCR targeting the
multiple-banded antigen gene to detect Ureaplasma spp.
PCR products from U. parvum and U. urealyticum can
be differentiated by size .

Microbiota profiles
Microbiota profiles were created by PCR amplification
and pyrosequencing of the cpn60 universal target region.
Hierarchical clustering of vaginal microbiota profiles
resulted in seven community state types
I
(CST):
(Lactobacillus crispatus dominated),
(Lactobacillus
gasseri dominated), III (Lactobacillus iners dominated),
IVA (Gardnerella vaginalis subgroup B or mix of differ-
ent species), IVC (G. vaginalis subgroup A dominated),
IVD (G. vaginalis
subgroup C dominated) and V
(Lactobacillus jensenii dominated) . Each CST is
defined by the dominance of one species of Lactobacillus (I,
II, III, V), Gardnerella vaginalis (IVC, IVD) or a mixture of
bacteria species (IVA), as previously described .

Overall microbiota profiles did not cluster together
based on gestational age at delivery (Figs. 1 and 2). Most
microbial profiles from the preterm group were
assigned to Latobacillus-dominated CST: CST I (37% of
profiles), CST III and CST II
were assigned to
CST IVA, IVC or IVD (Table 1). The CST IVA was the
most heterogeneous group, represented by the domin-
ance of Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Bifidobacterium den-
tium, Bifidobacterium infantis, Atopobium vaginae,
Bifidobacterium breve or a mixture of different bacteria
species. The CST IVC was dominated by G. vaginalis
subgroup A and Megasphaera spp., and CST IVD was
dominated by G. vaginalis subgroup C ..

assessed the relative abundance of each taxa (at the
OTU and species level) in term and preterm groups.
Eight OTU/species were more abundant in the term
group in comparison with preterm, all of which were
considered rare members of the bacterial community
. L. acidophilus represented 1% of the total reads
in the dataset and had a low relative abundance average
of 1.98% (range 0–69%) and 0.18% (range 0–0.87%) in
samples from term and preterm groups respectively. All
the other seven bacteria together represented only 0.4%
of the total reads in the dataset..

also
assessed (only species with at least 10 total reads were
included). A total of 60 taxa had significant differences
in prevalence between term and preterm groups; 11 spe-
cies had greater prevalence in the term cohort and 49
in the preterm cohort
species were more prevalent
(Table 3). Bifidobacterium infantis, for example, was two
times more prevalent in the term group in comparison
with preterm, and Prevotella timonensis was 1.58 times
more prevalent in the preterm group (Table 3). Several
Prevotella spp. were associated with both term and pre-
term. Prevotella amnii and P.
tannerae had greater
prevalence in the term cohort, whereas P. timonensis, P.
bivia, P. corporis and P. bucalis were more prevalent in
the preterm group (Table 3). It is important to note that
read depth distribution did not differ between term and
preterm cohorts (t test, p > 0.05); therefore, the differ-
ences observed here in bacteria prevalence were unlikely
to be driven by cohort sequencing bias..

Mollicutes (Mycoplasma and/or Ureaplasma) were de-
tected by family-specific conventional PCR in 28/46
of pregnant women who delivered preterm
(Table 1). Ureaplasma species were detected by
genus-specific PCR in samples of 14/46 women
who had PTB, with all women testing positive for U.
parvum and none for U. urealyticum. Women who de-
livered at term were less likely to be PCR positive for
Mollicutes compared to women who had PTB (Table 1).
No significant differences were observed in Ureaplasma
prevalence between the two groups (Table 1). An associ-
ation between Mollicutes/Ureaplasma detection and the
composition of the vaginal microbiota, represented as
CST, was also investigated. Detection of Mollicutes and
Ureaplasma was not associated with any CST in particu-
lar when investigated in the term cohort, preterm cohort
or both groups together (chi-square, p > 0.05)..

although we cannot address this question, it is possible
that sPTB driven by an ascending infection would be
more evident in a high-risk cohort or extreme preterm
cases. A recent study of a high-risk pregnant cohort has
reported that L. iners was strongly associated with short
cervix and preterm birth, as L. crispatus was associated
with term deliveries  Those differences in study out-
comes indicate that the pathogenesis of sPTB in low-
and high-risk groups might be different. Identifying dif-
ferences in the causes of early and late sPTB and the
role of the vaginal microbiota in those processes will re-
quire further study..

identified. The ALDEx2 analysis indicated that eight rare
taxa were more abundant in the term group, which does
not necessarily mean they are associated with a ‘health-
ier’ state or implicated in preventing sPTB. Since these
bacteria are detected at very low abundance within the
microbiota profiles, their biological significance in the
vaginal microbiome is questionable. Differences in the
prevalence of several other taxa between groups were
also observed. For example, more women in the term
group had Prevotella amnii and P. tannerae detected in
their vaginal samples, whereas P. timonensis, P. bivia, P.
corporis and P. bucalis were more frequently detected in
samples from women in the preterm group (Table 3).
Prevotella spp. have been previously associated with bac-
terial vaginosis and preterm labour  and our
results indicate that different Prevotella species might
have different roles in sPTB. Several of the taxa that
were significantly different in their prevalence among
women in the two groups also had low sequence read
counts (Table 3). Further investigation would be re-
quired to determine if these rare members of the micro-
bial community play a yet unknown role in sPTB..

Our results also confirmed previous reports of an as-
sociation between Mycoplasma and preterm birth 
Mollicutes were detected significantly more often in
women in the preterm group compared to women in the
term group, but no differences were observed in
Ureaplasma prevalence between groups indicating that
the difference in Mollicutes prevalence is primarily
driven by the presence of Mycoplasma spp. Although in-
dividual Mycoplasma species could not be discerned
based on assay used in our study, both Mycoplasma
genitalium 
have been previously associated with negative reproduct-
ive outcomes including PTB..

compare different study designs (based on different co-
horts and barcode gene) that addressed the same re-
search question. Hyman and colleagues described
the vaginal microbiota of 83 pregnant women (term n =
66, preterm n = 17) based on Sanger sequencing of
cloned 16S rRNA genes. Samples were collected at each
trimester and preterm was defined as delivery before
37 weeks of gestation. There was no correlation between
preterm and absence/low abundance of Lactobacillus in
the microbiota; in other words, preterm outcome could
not be predicted based on CST. Similar to our results,
they found an association between increased microbiota
diversity and preterm delivery among women of white
ethnicity (n = 40) (data from women of others ethnicities
was not included in the analysis because of small sample
sizes). Although there was no association between CST
and ethnicity, it is important to note that most women
enrolled in this study described themselves as being
white, and it is possible that an increased sample size of
participants of other ethnicities could result in a differ-
ent conclusion..

Most samples in the preterm group were dominated by
Lactobacillus, yet, they collectively had higher richness
and diversity compared to samples from the term group.
The increased microbiota richness/diversity might indi-
cate a transient state between Lactobacillus-dominated
CST and non-Lactobacillus-dominated, i.e., CST IV (A, C
or D). In other words, the increased richness and diversity
we observed might be a remnant characteristic of the pre-
vious disturbed microbiota. In summary, although we did
not “detect” a specific microbial community structure that
is associated with preterm birth, the increased microbiota
richness/diversity was associated with preterm birth. In
addition, the association with differences in Prevotella spe-
cies and Mycoplasma presence may point to signature
species associated with preterm birth.
