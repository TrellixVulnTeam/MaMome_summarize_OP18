Besides SCFA, gut microbiota-synthesized micronutrients
such as vitamins exhibit beneﬁcial value for both microbial
and host metabolisms. Vitamin-K-producing gut bacteria
namely Bacteroides fragilis, Eubacterium lentum, Enterobacter
agglomerans, Serratia marcescens, and Enterococcus faecium
(Fernandez and Collins, 1987; Cooke et al., 2006) anaerobically
synthesize vitamin K2 (menaquinone) which is essential
in
decreasing vascular calciﬁcation, elevating HDL and lowering
cholesterol levels, contributing to lower risk of cardiovascular
disorders such as atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease
(Kawashima et al., 1997; Geleijnse et al., 2004). Gut microbiota
also serves as an important source of vitamins B for the host
(Salminen et al., 1998; Degnan et al., 2014). Among them,
vitamins B5 and B12, which are exclusively synthesized by
intestinal microbiota, act as coenzyme for extensive range of host
biochemical processes including production of acetylcholine and
cortisol which are required for normal functioning of the nervous
system. Deﬁciency of vitamins B5 and B12 have been linked to
several disorders such as gastrointestinal discomfort, insomnia,
neuropsychological and hematological disorders (Andres et al.,
2004; Gominak, 2016). However, the possible link between loss of
vitamin-producing gut microbiota and disease onset has not yet
been elucidated.
