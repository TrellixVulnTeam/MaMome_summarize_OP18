Type sequences with Bergey’s taxonomy. Small-subunit rRNA sequences con-
sisting of 5,014 bacterial species type strain sequences in 988 genera (Table 1),
along with associated taxonomic assignment information, were obtained from
Bergey’s Taxonomic Outline of the Prokaryotes (release 5.0   The
sequences averaged 1,460 bases in length and had a range of 1,200 to 1,833 bases.
These sequences formed the Bergey corpus. Each sequence was labeled with
a set of taxa from domain to genus. From the highest rank to the lowest, the
major formal taxonomic ranks are domain, phylum, class, order, family,
genus, and species. There are occasional intermediate ranks such as “sub-
class” and “suborder”..

Using the RDP 9 alignment  we extracted segments cor-
responding to 100-base regions of the Escherichia coli refer-
ence sequence J01695 at 25-base intervals and used each re-
gion independently for exhaustive leave-one-out
testing,
removing the corresponding full-length sequence from training
for each test. In general, accuracy was greater for regions
mapping to the 16S hypervariable regions . The av-
erage bootstrap conﬁdence estimate was similarly higher in the
hypervariable regions ..

crepancies between the underlying phylogeny and
Bergey’s taxonomy. Over 60% of misclassiﬁed sequences were
actually more similar to sequences in other genera than to
sequences in their own genera, strong evidence that these
genera may not be monophyletic. These misclassiﬁcations are
not evenly distributed among the taxa. Of the three most rep-
resented phyla (Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria),
the Actinobacteria had the fewest errors (3%, or 31 in 1,220
trials), while the misclassiﬁcation rate for the Firmicutes was
about ﬁve times as high  Within
the Firmicutes, more than two-thirds of the errors occurred in
the class Clostridia  and within that class, the
genus Eubacterium stood out, with 30 misclassiﬁcations in 41
trials (see the supplemental material)..

FIG. 3. Phylogenetic analysis of the Alicyclobacillaceae, including
the genera Sulfobacillus and Alicyclobacillus. Sequences for each of the
11 species type strains of Alicyclobacillaceae available in release 5.0 of
Bergey’s taxonomic outline, along with additional sequences for four
Alicyclobacillaceae species type strains that became available after the
release of the outline (marked with an asterisk), and two Bacillus
species type strains were analyzed using the weighted neighbor-joining
method  The tree is rooted using Escherichia coli sequence J01695
as the outgroup. Bootstrap conﬁdence estimates above 85% are
shown. Three misclassiﬁcations made by the RDP Classiﬁer are high-
lighted, with the original (release 5.0) description appended with a
corrected description. S. disulﬁdooxidansT became A. disulﬁdooxi-
dansT. In 2005, S. disulﬁdooxidans was formally reclassiﬁed as a new
combination, A. disulﬁdooxidans  S. thermosulﬁdooxidans VKM
1269T became “A. tolerans K1.” In release 5, sequence Z21979 was
listed as coming from the type strain (VKM 1269) of S. thermosulﬁ-
dooxidans. This agrees with the original publication for the sequence
 The same group later reported that the sequence was probably
from S. thermosulﬁdooxidans strain K1, not VKM 1269  Two
independent sequences (X91080 and AB089844) for the type strain of
S. thermosulﬁdooxidans are available. They are nearly identical to each
other and 19% different from Z21979. In 2005, S.
thermosulﬁdooxidans strain K1 was reclassiﬁed as the type strain of a
new species, A. tolerans  In our analysis, however, the sequence for
K1 given in the naming paper (accession number AF137502) is 8%
different from that for Z21979. Although still listed in the GenBank
record as from A. tolerans strain K1, Z21979 is most probably not from
strain K1 and not even from a member of the species A. tolerans. A.
acidoterrestrisT became Bacillus sp. Sequence X60602 was published
in 1991 as from the type strain (DSM 3922) for A. acidoterrestris 
The GenBank record also lists this as from strain DSM 3922, but a
strain mix-up in the culture supplied by the DSMZ was reported in
1992  The type strain (ATCC 49025, listed by the DSMZ as
equivalent to DSM 3922) was resequenced in 2005 (AY573797 .
These two sequences are 14% different, and X60602 is now de-
scribed by GenBank as from a Bacillus sp.
