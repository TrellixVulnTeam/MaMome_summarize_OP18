Koren et al., reported a reduced microbial richness in the ﬁrst gestational trimester in women
who later developed GDM, but no difference in the microbiota composition when compared to
healthy pregnant women  On the contrary, speciﬁc differences between GDM and normoglycemic

Klebsiella variicola  Collinsella, Rothia, Desulfovibrio,
Actinobacteria and reduced gut richness of Methanobrevibacter smithii, Alistipes
species, Biﬁdobacterium species, Eubacterium species Akkermansia, Bacteroides, Parabacteroides,
Roseburia, and Dialister were reported in GDM patients compared to normoglycemic controls
(Figure 1). Some of the changes in the bacterial species related to GDM have been reported also in
T2DM patients, such as the reduction in Roseburia and Akkermansia muciniphila, and the increase in
Proteobacteria .

A few studies described a different microbiota within 3–16 months after delivery in women with
a previous GDM (GDM+) compared to those with a previous normoglycemic pregnancy (GDM−).
In particular, GDM+ women showed a higher abundance of Prevotellaceae, Collinsella, Olsenella,
and Clostridium and a reduction in Firmicutes, Fusobacterium and the parent family Fusobacteriaceae,
and genus Ruminococcus (Ruminococcus from Lachnospiraceae family)  Indeed, no gut microbiota
differences between GDM+ and GDM− women were found 5 years postpartum  Therefore,
the possibility that aberrant microbiota could contribute to the future development of T2DM in the
GDM+ women becomes less probable..

Only a few studies have evaluated the role of nutrition on maternal gut microbiota
during pregnancy. A lower ﬁber intake has been reported to be associated with reduced gut
microbiota diversity and richness  greater abundance of Collinsella, a genus associated with
T2DM  and greater abundance of Sutterella, a Proteobacteria with known pro-inﬂammatory
capacity  In pregnancy, vegetarian diets resulted in increased relative abundances of Roseburia and
Lachnospiraceae, but no difference in α-diversity when compared to omnivorous diets  A lower.

The impact of diet on the microbiota of GDM patients was recently addressed by an observational
study  Forty-one overweight women with GDM diagnosed at 24–28 weeks of gestation
received dietary recommendation from a registered dietitian, and their nutritional intakes and
microbiota were evaluated after the diagnosis of GDM (enrolment) and at the 38th week of gestation.
Women were considered as adherents to the given dietary recommendations if their intakes of
rapidly absorbed sugars and ﬁber were respectively <10% of total energy and at least 20 g/day,
and if they abolished alcohol intake at the end of the pregnancy. Adherents showed a signiﬁcant
decrease in Bacteroides  which is a genus that has been associated with high-fat animal-based
diets  Moreover, at enrolment, total fat intake was associated with higher abundance of Alistipes
and protein intake with Faecalibacterium genus, while, at the end of the pregnancy, ﬁber intake was
associated with the genus Roseburia  However, none of these bacteria were associated with the
changes in metabolic variables occurring during pregnancy in patients with GDM .

Despite the well-known role of MNT in the treatment of GDM  at present, there is no
consensus about the optimal composition of the diet and about which nutritional scheme should be
recommended  Historically, the main focus of MNT in GDM was carbohydrate restriction,
in particular simple sugar reduction  because this limitation reduces postprandial blood glucose
levels, thus leading to a lower glucose exposure for the fetus and consequently a reduced risk for
neonatal macrosomia  Nevertheless, evidence of the beneﬁts of carbohydrate restriction in GDM
is scarce, and recently this strategy has been questioned due to the unintended consequences of the
unavoidable increase in fat intake, if protein consumption remains in the recommended levels (15–20%
total energy)  It is well known that the amount and quality of fatty acids play relevant roles in
the modulation of insulin resistance  High-fat diets, in particular diets rich in SFAs, may promote
insulin resistance through several mechanisms, such as insulin signaling interfering  the promotion
of inﬂammation through tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) production  and increased oxidative
stress .

We do not eat alone, but also feed our microbiota, therefore we should also consider the effects
of food and nutrients on the composition of our intestinal microorganisms. From a “microbiota
point of view”, the high fat intake could potentially increase pro-inﬂammatory bacteria, resulting in
enhanced insulin resistance. High-fat diet has been associated with increased intestinal permeability
caused by high LPS serum levels, endotoxemia, and low-grade inﬂammation  In animal
studies, the consumption of high-SFA diets was observed to reduce the phylum Bacteroidetes (in
particular, Bacteroides and Prevotella genera), and the species Lactobacillus and Biﬁdobacterium 
In humans, high-fat diets have been reported to increase total anaerobic microbes, in particular the
Bacteroides genus, while low-fat diets led to an increase in the abundance of Biﬁdobacterium concomitant
with fasting glucose and total cholesterol reductions  In human pregnancy, a high-fat diet
determines an unfavorable microbial pattern, with a reduced bacterial richness, as described above 
Furthermore, the association between GDM and SFA intake has been documented .

The intakes of different MACs were associated with different microbe growth: prebiotic ﬁbers,
such as fructans, polydextrose, fructooligosaccharides (FOS), and galactooligosaccharides (GOS) were
linked to the growth of intestinal Biﬁdobacteri and Lactobacilli  resistant starch was reported to
increase the abundance of Ruminococcus, E. rectale, and Roseburia  In animal studies, low-MAC
diets resulted in over-grazing the mucus layer by the gut microbiota, potentially compromising the.

The “one-size-ﬁts-all” diet approach has been called into question for most metabolic disorders.
The individual response to diets is inﬂuenced by genetic, epigenetic, and microbial inﬂuences 
The metabolic response to speciﬁc foods based on the individual gut microbiota composition is
one of the emerging topics of interest in the ﬁeld of personalized nutrition  Recent studies
have identiﬁed individual enterotypes with different responses to speciﬁc diets  Based on the
predominant genus, people can be divided into three different clusters, called “enterotypes”: Bacteroides,
Prevotella, and Ruminococcus  with a high predominance of the ﬁrst two enterotypes around
the world. These clusters appear to be independent from nationality, sex, age, and body mass
index (BMI), but substantially determined by dietary habits  Prevotella (P-type) enterotype was
associated with a plant-based diet, rich in carbohydrates, resistant starch, and ﬁbers, whereas Bacteroides
(B-type) enterotype was associated with high-fat, low-ﬁber Western diets  Due to the speciﬁc
microbial enzymatic capacity, the P-type would have a greater ability to produce propionate from ﬁber
fermentation (in particular, arabinoxylans and β-glucans), with increased production of the satiating
PYY and GLP-1 hormones  The P-type subjects have been proven to lose weight with a high-ﬁber
diet rich in arabinoxylans and β-glucans  while the B-type individuals do not beneﬁt from
these ﬁbers. In a recent study, 3 days of barley kernel-based bread supplementation improved the
glucose metabolism only in subjects with higher Prevotella/Bacteroides ratios  conﬁrming the role
of arabinoxylans and β-glucans in the P-type individuals. On the other hand, the B-type individuals
could lose weight and improve their glucose metabolism with biﬁdobacteria-increasing interventions,
including prebiotics, such as inulin and oligosaccharides, or symbiotic treatment .

A Prevotellaceae-dominated intestinal microbiome has been observed after 3–16 months
from delivery in women with previous GDM when compared to women after a normoglycemic
pregnancy  Other studies conﬁrmed an increased abundance of the genus Prevotella in GDM in
the second trimester of gestation compared to normoglycemic subjects. Therefore,
overall, in GDM patients it could be hypothesized that there is a beneﬁcial effect resulting from the
increased consumption of foods containing arabinoxylans and β-glucans, such as rye, wheat, barley,
oats, sorghum, maize, millet, psyllium, and ﬂaxseed. In GDM patients, Bacteroides abundance has
been found to be either increased  A reduced abundance of Bacteroides at the
end of pregnancy has been described in women with GDM with a higher intake of total ﬁber and
oligosaccharides  This reduction in Bacteroides abundance could be considered positive, as this
genus has been associated with greater gestational weight gain  Therefore, only in the subgroup
of GDM patients with a higher relative abundance of Bacteroides, biﬁdogenic prebiotic ﬁbers (FOS,
GOS and inulin, contained in foods such as legumes, chicory roots, Jerusalem artichokes, onions, garlic,
asparagus, daikon, and leek) might be beneﬁcial to control the gestational weight gain.
