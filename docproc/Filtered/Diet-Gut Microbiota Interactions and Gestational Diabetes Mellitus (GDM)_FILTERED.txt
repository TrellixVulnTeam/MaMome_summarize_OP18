However, at present, literature on microbiota composition in pregnancy is highly discordant,
reporting no variations  increased Proteobacteria/Actinobacteria abundance, Roseburia intestinalis
and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii reduction, and α-diversity decrease  Gestational weight gain
has been associated with higher concentrations of Bacteroides species 
Enterobacteriaceae and Escherichia coli  reduced abundance of Biﬁdobacterium and Akkermansia
muciniphila  Many correlations among speciﬁc taxa and gestational
metabolic variables have been found, such as direct relationships between Collinsella and circulating
triglycerides, and very-low-density lipoproteins; Sutterella and C-reactive
levels of insulin,
protein; Ruminococcaceae/Lachnospiraceae and leptin; Bacteroidaceae and ghrelin; Coprococcus
and gastrointestinal polypeptide (GIP). Moreover, inverse relationships between Blautia and insulin
values; Faecalibacterium/Fusobacterium ratios and blood glucose; Odoribacter and arterial blood pressure;
Ruminococcaceae and GIP, and Prevotellaceae and ghrelin have been reported  Therefore,
gut microbiota might contribute to gestational metabolic changes through different mechanisms,
although further studies on this topic are necessary..

The impact of diet on the microbiota of GDM patients was recently addressed by an observational
study  Forty-one overweight women with GDM diagnosed at 24–28 weeks of gestation
received dietary recommendation from a registered dietitian, and their nutritional intakes and
microbiota were evaluated after the diagnosis of GDM (enrolment) and at the 38th week of gestation.
Women were considered as adherents to the given dietary recommendations if their intakes of
rapidly absorbed sugars and ﬁber were respectively <10% of total energy and at least 20 g/day,
and if they abolished alcohol intake at the end of the pregnancy. Adherents showed a signiﬁcant
decrease in Bacteroides  which is a genus that has been associated with high-fat animal-based
diets  Moreover, at enrolment, total fat intake was associated with higher abundance of Alistipes
and protein intake with Faecalibacterium genus, while, at the end of the pregnancy, ﬁber intake was
associated with the genus Roseburia  However, none of these bacteria were associated with the
changes in metabolic variables occurring during pregnancy in patients with GDM .

Despite the well-known role of MNT in the treatment of GDM  at present, there is no
consensus about the optimal composition of the diet and about which nutritional scheme should be
recommended  Historically, the main focus of MNT in GDM was carbohydrate restriction,
in particular simple sugar reduction  because this limitation reduces postprandial blood glucose
levels, thus leading to a lower glucose exposure for the fetus and consequently a reduced risk for
neonatal macrosomia  Nevertheless, evidence of the beneﬁts of carbohydrate restriction in GDM
is scarce, and recently this strategy has been questioned due to the unintended consequences of the
unavoidable increase in fat intake, if protein consumption remains in the recommended levels (15–20%
total energy)  It is well known that the amount and quality of fatty acids play relevant roles in
the modulation of insulin resistance  High-fat diets, in particular diets rich in SFAs, may promote
insulin resistance through several mechanisms, such as insulin signaling interfering  the promotion
of inﬂammation through tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) production  and increased oxidative
stress .

We do not eat alone, but also feed our microbiota, therefore we should also consider the effects
of food and nutrients on the composition of our intestinal microorganisms. From a “microbiota
point of view”, the high fat intake could potentially increase pro-inﬂammatory bacteria, resulting in
enhanced insulin resistance. High-fat diet has been associated with increased intestinal permeability
caused by high LPS serum levels, endotoxemia, and low-grade inﬂammation  In animal
studies, the consumption of high-SFA diets was observed to reduce the phylum Bacteroidetes (in
particular, Bacteroides and Prevotella genera), and the species Lactobacillus and Biﬁdobacterium 
In humans, high-fat diets have been reported to increase total anaerobic microbes, in particular the
Bacteroides genus, while low-fat diets led to an increase in the abundance of Biﬁdobacterium concomitant
with fasting glucose and total cholesterol reductions  In human pregnancy, a high-fat diet
determines an unfavorable microbial pattern, with a reduced bacterial richness, as described above 
Furthermore, the association between GDM and SFA intake has been documented .

A Prevotellaceae-dominated intestinal microbiome has been observed after 3–16 months
from delivery in women with previous GDM when compared to women after a normoglycemic
pregnancy  Other studies conﬁrmed an increased abundance of the genus Prevotella in GDM in
the second trimester of gestation compared to normoglycemic subjects. Therefore,
overall, in GDM patients it could be hypothesized that there is a beneﬁcial effect resulting from the
increased consumption of foods containing arabinoxylans and β-glucans, such as rye, wheat, barley,
oats, sorghum, maize, millet, psyllium, and ﬂaxseed. In GDM patients, Bacteroides abundance has
been found to be either increased  A reduced abundance of Bacteroides at the
end of pregnancy has been described in women with GDM with a higher intake of total ﬁber and
oligosaccharides  This reduction in Bacteroides abundance could be considered positive, as this
genus has been associated with greater gestational weight gain  Therefore, only in the subgroup
of GDM patients with a higher relative abundance of Bacteroides, biﬁdogenic prebiotic ﬁbers (FOS,
GOS and inulin, contained in foods such as legumes, chicory roots, Jerusalem artichokes, onions, garlic,
asparagus, daikon, and leek) might be beneﬁcial to control the gestational weight gain.
