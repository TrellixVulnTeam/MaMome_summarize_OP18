in  the  exercised  group  belonged  to  phyla 
Tenericutes, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes. 
The most striking change in exercised mice 
was a decrease in Erysipelotrichaceae bacterium 
C11_K211 from phylum Tenericutes, which 
decreased dramatically in exercised compared 
with seden tary mice..

Although  Enterococci  are  commensal 
bacteria, they are also important nosocomial 
pathogens  that  cause  bacteremia,  endo­ 
carditis, and other infections in humans. Some 
strains are resistant to multiple anti biotics and 
possess  virulence  factors,  such  as  adhesins, 
invasins, pili, and haemolysin (Willems et al. 
2011). Nevertheless, E. faecium isolates from 
clinical outbreaks are different strains than 
E. faecium from animals, food, and humans 
in  the  community  (Franz  et  al.  2011).  In .

fact, several enterococci, including E. faecium 
strains, are used as probiotics in the form of 
pharmaceutical preparations. They are adminis­ 
tered to treat diarrhea, antibiotic­associated 
diarrhea,  and  irritable  bowel  syndrome;  to 
lower cholesterol levels; or to improve host 
immunity (Franz et al. 2011).
