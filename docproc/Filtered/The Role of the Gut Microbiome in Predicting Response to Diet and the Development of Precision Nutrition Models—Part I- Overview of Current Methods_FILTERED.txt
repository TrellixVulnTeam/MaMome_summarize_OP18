Arumugam et al. first introduced the concept of
“enterotypes”, clustering individuals into 3 groups according
to their dominant genera: Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Ru-
minococcus. Although enterotypes have since been shown
to exist more on a continuous scale  the Bacteroides
and Prevotella enterotypes have been consistently replicated
across cohorts  The identification of the Ruminococcus
enterotype is more dependent on clustering and modeling
approaches  Roager
et al. 
and Chen et al.  highlight measures such as enterotype or
the Prevotella to Bacteroides ratio. Diversity and richness are
also common measures used to highlight differences between
groups .

Both animal and in vitro models have limitations when
it comes to drawing conclusions about human health and
nutrition as they lack the specific interactions present in
the human supraorganism. For further information, readers
are directed to additional reviews of animal and
in vitro models for human nutrition research.
However, these techniques used in combination with human
clinical trials will be crucial in the development of precision
nutrition research and our understanding of the interaction
between the host and the gut microbiota..
