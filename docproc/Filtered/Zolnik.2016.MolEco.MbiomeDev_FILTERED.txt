6_PARAGRAPHS

relationships
between internal microorganisms and I. scapularis have
focused on commonly studied human pathogens. For
example, infection of blacklegged ticks by A. phagocy-
tophilum (the causative agent of granulocytic anaplas-
mosis in humans) has been shown to induce protein
expression that increases cold tolerance and, depend-
ing on weather patterns, may aid in tick survival
(Neelakanta et al. 2010). Furthermore,
infection with
B. burgdorferi has been shown to affect questing beha-
viour and movement of
this tick, possibly affecting
survival and/or pathogen transmission (Lefcort &
Durden 1996). However, little is known regarding the
range of microbes the tick comes in contact with or
maintains throughout
its entire life cycle. This tick
experiences a 2-year life cycle, feeding once per life
stage (larva, nymph, and adult) on vertebrate blood.
These bloodmeals are necessary for
the immature
stages (larva, nymph) to moult to the next stage and
for adult females to lay eggs (Needham & Teel 1991;
there are numerous opportunities
Fish 1993). Thus,
for this tick to acquire microbes either during any of
its three bloodmeals or possibly from the environ-
ment, as it spends 98% of its life cycle off-host in a
forested setting (Needham & Teel 1991; Fish 1993).

A total of 21 samples – three pools for each of the ﬁve
life stage categories (lab-reared larvae, ﬁeld-collected
larvae, ﬁeld-collected nymphs, ﬁeld-collected adult
females, and ﬁeld-collected adult males), and three
pools for female salivary glands and female midguts –
generated 10 896 297 raw reads on one Illumina MiSeq
ﬂow cell. A total of 6 908 532 sequences passed ﬁlter
and were assigned taxonomy. This resulted in 116 941–
452 654 (mean = 328 977, SD = 96 960) high-quality,
merged sequences per sample (Table S1, Supporting
information). The negative control resulted in <0.001%
(n = 606) of all sequences and was excluded from fur-
ther analysis. The conditional uncovered probability of
the samples, on average,
indicated a high likelihood
that over 99.9% of the bacterial taxa in the samples was
covered. Rarefaction curves from a depth of 1000 to
100 000 sequences indicated sufﬁcient sequencing cov-
erage, as demonstrated by observed OTU accumulation
curves reaching a plateau (Fig. S2, Supporting informa-
tion)..

At the genus level, Rickettsia had the highest relative
abundance across all developmental stage
samples. In all, 13 genera (and one family-level taxon)
were present with a relative abundance of 1% or greater
in at least one sample . The relative abundance
of non-Rickettsia taxa increased along developmental
stages (i.e. larvae to nymphs to adults) with the excep-
tion of adult females, which displayed the highest rela-
tive abundance of Rickettsia of all ﬁeld-collected life
stages . Freshly hatched larvae also had a high
relative abundance of Rickettsia . Seven taxa were
found in all female and all freshly hatched larvae sam-
ples (matching to the genera Rickettsia, Phyllobacterium,
Burkholderia, Sphingomonas, Pseudomonas and the families
Comamonadaceae
and Oxalobacteraceae); however,
females harboured more observed OTUs than freshly
hatched larvae . Adult males had the lowest pro-
portion of Rickettsia and thus had more genera
with a relative abundance of ≥1% of any developmental
stage. Wolbachia was the genus with the second highest.

relative abundance in males (mean = 8.4%) and was
found in all other life stages, but not in all samples,
with a low relative abundance (<0.1%). All ﬁeld-col-
lected developmental stages contained Sphingomonas,
Methylobacterium, Hymenobacter, Pseudomonas, Rhizobium,
Agrobacterium, Luteibacter, Mycobacterium and Curtobac-
terium. Both Borrelia and Anaplasma were only found in
nymphs and adults..

Dermacentor and Haemaphysalis ticks (Piesman & Gage
2004), Rickettsia amblyommii isolated from the American
lone star tick Amblyomma americanum (Stromdahl et al.
2008), Rickettsia conorii and Rickettsia rhipicephali isolated
from the brown dog tick Rhipicephalus sanguineus (Hayes
& Burgdorfer 1979; Parola et al. 2009). Overall, short
sequences could not be unambiguously placed on single
branches, but were rather assigned along a clade, which
lends a certain degree of conﬁdence. Global placement
uncertainty was elevated, as captured by the EPA’s
entropy measure (mean = 0.7767, SD = 0.0699). The
placement of our sequences on the reference tree can be
explored interactively on the iToL webserver (http://
itol.embl.de/tree/286234201192691468834200)..

blacklegged ticks (Moreno et al. 2006; Yuan 2010; Haw-
lena et al. 2013; Rynkiewicz et al. 2015; Van Treuren et al.
2015). Rickettsia are obligate, intracellular bacteria associ-
ated with eukaryotes,
including arthropods (Perlman
et al. 2006). Although many Rickettsia species are non-
pathogenic (Ahantarig et al. 2013), a number of them are
including Rickettsia rick-
known tick-borne pathogens,
ettsii, R. conorii, R. sibirica, R. japonica, R. australis and
R. akari (Azad & Beard 1998). The Rickettsia endosym-
biont of I. scapularis, presumed to be nonpathogenic, has
been identiﬁed in this tick in previous studies (Noda
et al. 1997; Benson et al. 2004; Moreno et al. 2006; Gille-
spie et al. 2012; Kurtti et al. 2015) and is believed to be
the only Rickettsia species found in this tick (Gillespie
et al. 2012; Kurtti et al. 2015). Recently, the name Rick-
ettsia buchneri has been proposed for this species (Kurtti
et al. 2015). The vast majority of our sequences were
assigned to the rickettsial clade isolated from Ixodes ticks
using a phylogenetic tree-guided procedure. Although
individual short sequences could not be assigned to sin-
gle tree branches with full conﬁdence, they were mostly
assigned to neighbouring branches within a clade of sis-
ter endosymbionts isolated from the same tick species.
We interpret this as an indication of sufﬁcient evolution-
ary informativeness
identiﬁcation of our
sequences at the clade level grosso modo, combined with
the observation of greater divergence patterns of this
locus in Rickettsia.
