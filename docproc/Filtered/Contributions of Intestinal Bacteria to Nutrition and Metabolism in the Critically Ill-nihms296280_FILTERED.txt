Perhaps the foremost lesson of these recent efforts has been that all humans, both healthy
and critically ill, are intimately associated with a vast population of microbial organisms.
Uncertainty remains regarding the precise number of bacteria in the human body, but it is
generally agreed that there at least 10 bacterial cells for every 1 human cell [7]. This has led
authorities in the field to describe humans as “superorganisms” composed of both human
and microbial cells [8]. Although clinicians have not historically thought about their patients
in this way, it is easy to recognize the evolutionary logic of a symbiotic relationship between
humans and microbes. By supporting lifelong colonization by organisms that possess a
diverse set of metabolic capabilities, the host effectively augments its own genome; this is a
much more efficient arrangement than waiting for humans to evolve new metabolic
capacities on their own [9]. In return for their contributions, microbes associated with the
body are rewarded with a relatively safe, predictable, and nutrient-rich niche for
colonization. As will be discussed in subsequent sections, the impact of critical illness on
this symbiotic relationship remains poorly understood.
Genomic analysis of gut bacteria offers vivid examples of the role of microbes in nutrient
utilization. For example, in 2003, Xu, et al. published the complete genome sequence of the
gram-negative anaerobe Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a prominent member of the normal
intestinal microbiota [10]. Annotation and analysis of the genome revealed a sophisticated
apparatus for acquiring and digesting otherwise unusable dietary polysaccharides. This
apparatus, including a complex, multi-component, multi-enzyme complex starch utilization
system (SUS), consists of over 230 glycoside hydrolase and 15 polysaccharide lyase genes
[15]. The genomic analysis demonstrated that B. thetaiotaomicron has evolved the
remarkable capacity to sense the availability of carbohydrates in its microenvironment, and
that it also has the ability to forage and utilize host-derived glycans (e.g., mucin and
heparin). Mechanistic studies in gnotobiotic animals further demonstrated that, when B.
thetaiotaomicron senses a scarcity of fucose in the intestinal lumen, it actually induces the
gut epithelium to upregulate expression of fucosylated glycans that can be used by the
bacteria as an energy source without harming the host [16]. This body of work illustrates
how the remarkable host-microbe symbiosis can be teased apart by pairing genomic
sequencing efforts with creative in vivo laboratory studies.
If one accepts that a “healthy” intestinal microbiota serves important biological functions,
then it is reasonable to hypothesize that gut microbial communities can be manipulated or
“optimized” during critical illness to increase the chances of achieving desired clinical
outcomes. In theory, manipulation of the gut microbiota could be used to improve energy
balance and decrease the incidence of infectious complications. A fundamental problem
with clinical application of this theory has been that we lack a detailed understanding of if
and how the microbiome is altered during critical illness. As a result, interventions in this
field have been introduced with a limited scientific foundation. Nonetheless, several
strategies to optimize the microbiome have now been evaluated clinically. Some, such as the
recent description of fecal transplantation for Clostridium difficile colitis [62], will not be
discussed here. Others with obvious relevance to nutrition are discussed.
Another possible approach to improve outcomes for critically ill patients is to manipulate the
intestinal microenvironment to maintain the local microbial ecology of the GI tract
indirectly. It is well established that the use of vasoactive pressors, antibiotics, and highly
processed nutrients will change not only the local microbiota, but also pH, oxygen tension,
SCFA production, and various critical micronutrients that maintain the health of normal
intestinal microbes. Our group and others have shown that maintenance of a more acidic
intestinal pH through the course of surgical injury and administration of oral pH solutions
enhance local intestinal immunity and prevent lethal gut-derived sepsis [74]). Most recently
we have shown that surgical injury causes a rapid depletion of mucus phosphate, thereby
inducing certain strains of pathogenic bacteria to upregulate their virulence against the
intestinal epithelial barrier [75]. Most bacteria that cause serious infections in ICU patients
are equipped with exquisite sensory mechanisms to detect the level of local phosphate
concentration. Phosphate concentration is a key trigger by which bacteria activate their
virulence machinery to, in some cases, cause lethal sepsis. When phosphate levels are high
at sites of local microbial colonization, such as the intestinal mucus, microbes use the PhoB
phosphosensory/phosphoregulatory system to repress virulence activation. However, during
phosphate depletion, the PhoB system is derepressed and virulence is activated even to the
point of tissue invasion, immune activation, and organ failure [75]. The PhoB and analogous
systems are highly conserved among microbes and offer an opportunity for clinicians to
understand the precise host signals that trigger microbes to transform from indolent
colonizers to lethal pathogens rapidly. We have shown in animal studies that maintenance of
local phosphate concentration can suppress virulence activation among highly pathogenic
bacteria such as P. aeruginosa even during periods of severe physiologic stress [74]. This
also appears to be the case for other pathogens such as C. albicans and E. faecalis
(unpublished observations). Therefore, providing therapies at the microenvironmental level
could be a novel approach to create molecular diplomacy between pathogen and host
through the course of severe physiologic stress such as that which occurs during human
critical illness.
