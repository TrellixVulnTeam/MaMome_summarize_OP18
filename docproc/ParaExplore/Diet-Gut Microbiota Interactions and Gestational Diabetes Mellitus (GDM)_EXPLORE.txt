Dysbiosis, an altered microbiota composition, has been hypothesized to play a key role in the
pathogenesis of many acute and chronic conditions, including metabolic diseases, such as obesity,
insulin resistance, and both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) [20,21]. Several mechanisms
linking dysbiosis to dysmetabolic conditions have been identiﬁed, such as abnormal gut permeability,
increasing absorption of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), abnormal SCFA production, aberrant conversion of
primary bile acids to secondary bile acids, increased production of bacterial toxic substances, such as
trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) [20,21]. These abnormalities lead to the activation of inﬂammatory
and autoimmune pathways, autoantigen mimics, stimulation of the endocannabinoid system, aberrant
gut peptide secretion, impairment of insulin signaling, increased energy extraction, and host fat
storage [22,23].

However, at present, literature on microbiota composition in pregnancy is highly discordant,
reporting no variations [28], increased Proteobacteria/Actinobacteria abundance, Roseburia intestinalis
and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii reduction, and α-diversity decrease [13]. Gestational weight gain
has been associated with higher concentrations of Bacteroides species [29], Staphylococcus [29,30],
Enterobacteriaceae and Escherichia coli [30], reduced abundance of Biﬁdobacterium and Akkermansia
muciniphila [30], and lower α-diversity [31]. Many correlations among speciﬁc taxa and gestational
metabolic variables have been found, such as direct relationships between Collinsella and circulating
triglycerides, and very-low-density lipoproteins; Sutterella and C-reactive
levels of insulin,
protein; Ruminococcaceae/Lachnospiraceae and leptin; Bacteroidaceae and ghrelin; Coprococcus
and gastrointestinal polypeptide (GIP). Moreover, inverse relationships between Blautia and insulin
values; Faecalibacterium/Fusobacterium ratios and blood glucose; Odoribacter and arterial blood pressure;
Ruminococcaceae and GIP, and Prevotellaceae and ghrelin have been reported [27,32,33]. Therefore,
gut microbiota might contribute to gestational metabolic changes through different mechanisms,
although further studies on this topic are necessary.

5. Gut Microbiota in Pregnancies Complicated by GDM The physiological insulin resistance of late-pregnancy is accentuated in women developing GDM,
thus their insulin secretion is not sufﬁcient to maintain euglycemia, leading to glucose intolerance [34].

Overall, insulin resistance has been found to be associated with a higher Nutrients 2019, 11, 330 4 of 13 ratio and a reduced abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria such as Roseburia and Faecalibacterium
prausnitzii [35–37].

7. Diet-Microbiota Interactions in GDM The impact of diet on the microbiota of GDM patients was recently addressed by an observational
study [33]. Forty-one overweight women with GDM diagnosed at 24–28 weeks of gestation
received dietary recommendation from a registered dietitian, and their nutritional intakes and
microbiota were evaluated after the diagnosis of GDM (enrolment) and at the 38th week of gestation.
Women were considered as adherents to the given dietary recommendations if their intakes of
rapidly absorbed sugars and ﬁber were respectively <10% of total energy and at least 20 g/day,
and if they abolished alcohol intake at the end of the pregnancy. Adherents showed a signiﬁcant
decrease in Bacteroides [33], which is a genus that has been associated with high-fat animal-based
diets [50]. Moreover, at enrolment, total fat intake was associated with higher abundance of Alistipes
and protein intake with Faecalibacterium genus, while, at the end of the pregnancy, ﬁber intake was
associated with the genus Roseburia [33]. However, none of these bacteria were associated with the
changes in metabolic variables occurring during pregnancy in patients with GDM [33].

Nutrients 2019, 11, 330 6 of 13 8. Microbiota: A Novel Potential Therapeutic Target in GDM? Despite the well-known role of MNT in the treatment of GDM [11], at present, there is no
consensus about the optimal composition of the diet and about which nutritional scheme should be
recommended [56,57]. Historically, the main focus of MNT in GDM was carbohydrate restriction,
in particular simple sugar reduction [58], because this limitation reduces postprandial blood glucose
levels, thus leading to a lower glucose exposure for the fetus and consequently a reduced risk for
neonatal macrosomia [59]. Nevertheless, evidence of the beneﬁts of carbohydrate restriction in GDM
is scarce, and recently this strategy has been questioned due to the unintended consequences of the
unavoidable increase in fat intake, if protein consumption remains in the recommended levels (15–20%
total energy) [56,58]. It is well known that the amount and quality of fatty acids play relevant roles in
the modulation of insulin resistance [60]. High-fat diets, in particular diets rich in SFAs, may promote
insulin resistance through several mechanisms, such as insulin signaling interfering [60], the promotion
of inﬂammation through tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) production [61], and increased oxidative
stress [62].

We do not eat alone, but also feed our microbiota, therefore we should also consider the effects
of food and nutrients on the composition of our intestinal microorganisms. From a “microbiota
point of view”, the high fat intake could potentially increase pro-inﬂammatory bacteria, resulting in
enhanced insulin resistance. High-fat diet has been associated with increased intestinal permeability
caused by high LPS serum levels, endotoxemia, and low-grade inﬂammation [63,64]. In animal
studies, the consumption of high-SFA diets was observed to reduce the phylum Bacteroidetes (in
particular, Bacteroides and Prevotella genera), and the species Lactobacillus and Biﬁdobacterium [65].
In humans, high-fat diets have been reported to increase total anaerobic microbes, in particular the
Bacteroides genus, while low-fat diets led to an increase in the abundance of Biﬁdobacterium concomitant
with fasting glucose and total cholesterol reductions [15,66]. In human pregnancy, a high-fat diet
determines an unfavorable microbial pattern, with a reduced bacterial richness, as described above [44].
Furthermore, the association between GDM and SFA intake has been documented [67].

A decade ago, doubts about the effectiveness of low-carbohydrate diets in GDM began to emerge
and nowadays the focus has moved from carbohydrate restriction to carbohydrate quality; in particular,
diets with low glycemic index (GI) and/or rich in complex unreﬁned carbohydrates have been studied
with promising results [68–70]. Different types of complex carbohydrates exert different impacts on
microbiota composition. First of all, the terminology used needs to be clariﬁed. The generic term
“ﬁber” (i.e., undigestible carbohydrates) in the context of microbiota is misleading. Not all ﬁbers can be
used by gut microbes, such as cellulose, while other carbohydrates that are not ﬁbers can be fermented
by our intestinal microorganisms, such as resistant starches. Recently, the term microbiota accessible
carbohydrates (MACs) has been proposed [71]. Microbial fermentation of MACs produces SCFAs
(acetate, propionate, and butyrate), which are able to activate G-protein-coupled receptors (GPRs),
such as GPR41 and GPR43, triggering the secretion of gut hormones (glucagon-like peptide 1 -GLP-1,
and peptide YY -PYY) by intestinal epithelial L-cells, and the secretion of leptin by adipocytes [18],
resulting in appetite decrease [72,73], and improved insulin sensitivity [18]. SCFAs can suppress
lipolysis, and the release of inﬂammatory mediators, such as nitric oxide (NO), TNF-α, interleukin
1-beta (IL-1β), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) [73–77]. Butyrate and propionate are generally considered
beneﬁcial [18], while the role of acetate is still controversial in humans [78]. Indeed, the role of SCFAs in
energy homeostasis is ambiguous. Fecal SCFAs have been found to be increased in the gut microbiota
of people with obesity [79] and this might indicate a greater ability to extract energy from undigested
foods contributing to the development of obesity [18,80].

The intakes of different MACs were associated with different microbe growth: prebiotic ﬁbers,
such as fructans, polydextrose, fructooligosaccharides (FOS), and galactooligosaccharides (GOS) were
linked to the growth of intestinal Biﬁdobacteri and Lactobacilli [81]; resistant starch was reported to
increase the abundance of Ruminococcus, E. rectale, and Roseburia [15,82]. In animal studies, low-MAC
diets resulted in over-grazing the mucus layer by the gut microbiota, potentially compromising the Nutrients 2019, 11, 330 7 of 13 integrity of the mucosal barrier and increasing inﬂammation and susceptibility to pathogens [83].
Intriguingly, the selective use of speciﬁc MACs could have a different impact on microbiota composition
and consequently on host metabolism. Therefore, not only carbohydrate quality but also the type of
MAC should be considered in the deﬁnition of the optimal diet for GDM patients.

A Prevotellaceae-dominated intestinal microbiome has been observed after 3–16 months
from delivery in women with previous GDM when compared to women after a normoglycemic
pregnancy [41]. Other studies conﬁrmed an increased abundance of the genus Prevotella in GDM in
the second [38] and third [39] trimester of gestation compared to normoglycemic subjects. Therefore,
overall, in GDM patients it could be hypothesized that there is a beneﬁcial effect resulting from the
increased consumption of foods containing arabinoxylans and β-glucans, such as rye, wheat, barley,
oats, sorghum, maize, millet, psyllium, and ﬂaxseed. In GDM patients, Bacteroides abundance has
been found to be either increased [32] or decreased [39]. A reduced abundance of Bacteroides at the
end of pregnancy has been described in women with GDM with a higher intake of total ﬁber and
oligosaccharides [33]. This reduction in Bacteroides abundance could be considered positive, as this
genus has been associated with greater gestational weight gain [29]. Therefore, only in the subgroup
of GDM patients with a higher relative abundance of Bacteroides, biﬁdogenic prebiotic ﬁbers (FOS,
GOS and inulin, contained in foods such as legumes, chicory roots, Jerusalem artichokes, onions, garlic,
asparagus, daikon, and leek) might be beneﬁcial to control the gestational weight gain.

knowledge should be recognized. At present, we are still far from ﬁnding a personalized dietary
treatment for GDM patients. First of all, our knowledge about gut microbiota and diet response in
pregnancy complicated by GDM is limited. Furthermore, gut microbiota is just one of the components
that can determine personalized responses to diet therapy; future studies on personalized nutrition
should take into account and integrate all the possible variables, including genetics and clinical
parameters. Finally, doubts have recently been raised about the beneﬁt of probiotics in preventing
GDM, thus questioning the role of microbiota in pregnancy hyperglycemia [96]
