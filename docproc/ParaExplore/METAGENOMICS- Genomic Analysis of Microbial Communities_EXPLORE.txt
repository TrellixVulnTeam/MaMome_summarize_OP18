However, standard culturing techniques account for 1% or less of the\nbacterial diversity in most environmental samples (2). Although some signiﬁcant\nbreakthroughs have resulted from recent attempts to culture the as-yet-unculturable\nbacteria (56, 89, 99, 127), a suite of culture-independent techniques are needed to\ncomplement efforts to culture the thousands or millions of unknown species in the\nenvironment.\n\nA new era of microbial ecology was initiated when sequencing of ribosomal\nRNAs and the genes encoding them was introduced to describe uncultured bacteria\nin the environment. The ﬁrst approach was to sequence clones from a 5S rRNA\ncDNA library derived from the symbiotic community within the tubeworm Riftia\npachyptila (109). Variations of this method generated a set of culture-independent\ntechniques to (a) reconstruct phylogenies, (b) compare microbial distributions\namong samples using either nucleotide sequence or restriction fragment length\npolymorphisms (RFLPs), and (c) quantify the relative abundance of each taxo-\nnomic group using membrane hybridization or ﬂuorescent in situ hybridization (2,\n47, 57, 78–80).\n\nThe most startling result of the many microbial diversity studies that have\nemployed 16S rRNA culture-independent methods is the richness of the uncultured\nmicrobial world. As of April 1, 2004, GenBank contained 21,466 16S rRNA genes\nfrom cultured prokaryotes and 54,655 from uncultured prokaryotes, according to\nthe search terms described by Rapp´e & Giovannoni (90), and many of those from\nuncultured organisms afﬁliate with phyla that contain no cultured members. When\nWoese (121) originally proposed a 16S rRNA-based phylogeny, 12 bacterial phyla\nwere recognized, each with cultured representatives. Since then, 14 additional\nphyla with cultured representatives have been identiﬁed. In addition, 16S rRNA\ngene sequence analysis suggests 26 candidate phyla that have no known cultured\nrepresentatives (90). Therefore, half of the known microbial phyla have no cultured\nrepresentatives.\n\nAmong the phyla that contain cultured members, a few contain many isolates\nand the rest contain too few to represent the full spectrum of diversity in the\nphylum. For example, Hugenholtz (53) found that 97% of prokaryotes deposited\nin the Australian Culture of Microorganisms in 2001 were members of just four\nphyla: the Proteobacteria (54%), Actinobacteria (23%), Firmicutes (14%), and\n\nAnnu.

Within GenBank, 76% of the 16S rRNA gene sequences of\ncultured prokaryotes are from these four groups. But other phyla may be more\ndiverse, prevalent, and ecologically consequential in the environment. 16S rRNA\ngene sequences from the Acidobacterium phylum are among the most abundant\nin clone libraries obtained from soil and have been found in all soils examined,\nsuggesting that the Acidobacteria play important roles in soil ecosystems. How-\never, of the 684 Acidobacterium 16S rRNA gene sequences in GenBank, only 19\n(2.8%) are from cultured isolates, providing an inadequate collection to describe\nthe physiological diversity of the phylum. Other than 16S rRNA gene sequences,\nlittle is known about the bacteria within the 22 poorly cultured phyla and 26 candi-\ndate phyla. Many terms, such as unculturable, uncultivated, as yet uncultured, and\nnot yet cultured, are used to refer to microorganisms that we know of only through\nculture-independent means. In this review, we refer to them as uncultured.\n\nDescribing the phylogenetic diversity of uncultured microorganisms is only the\nﬁrst step. A greater challenge is to assign ecological roles to them. The uncultured\nmicrobiota must play pivotal roles in natural environmental processes and are a\nlarge untapped resource for biotechnology applications. Exploiting the rich micro-\nbial biodiversity for enzyme and natural product discovery is an active research\narea that has been reviewed elsewhere (39, 45, 46, 65, 66, 77, 97, 104). This re-\nview discusses the application of culture-independent genomics-based approaches\nto understand the genetic diversity, population structure, and ecology of complex\nmicrobial assemblages (26, 93, 94).\n\nMETAGENOMICS DEFINED\n\n“Metagenomics” describes the functional and sequence-based analysis of the col-\nlective microbial genomes contained in an environmental sample (Figure 1) (45).\nOther terms have been used to describe the same method, including environ-\nmental DNA libraries (110), zoolibraries (55), soil DNA libraries (68), eDNA\nlibraries (13), recombinant environmental libraries (22), whole genome treasures\n(77), community genome (114), whole genome shotgun sequencing (115), and\nprobably others. In this review, we use metagenomics to describe work that has\nbeen presented with all of these names because it is the most commonly used term\n(15, 27, 35, 59–61, 65, 66, 82, 105, 107, 117, 118), was used for the title of the ﬁrst\ninternational conference on the topic (“Metagenomics 2003” held in Darmstadt,\nGermany), and is the focus of an upcoming issue of the journal Environmental Mi-\ncrobiology. The deﬁnition applied here excludes studies that use PCR to amplify\ngene cassettes (52) or random PCR primers to access genes of interest (17, 32),\nsince these methods do not provide genomic information beyond the genes that are\nampliﬁed. Many environments have been the focus of metagenomics, including\nsoil, the oral cavity, feces, and aquatic habitats, as well as the hospital metagenome,\na term intended to encompass the genetic potential of organisms in hospitals that\nconribute to public health concerns such as antibiotic resistance and nosocomial\ninfections (20).\n\nAnnu.

(106), who constructed\na λ phage library from a seawater sample and screened it for 16S rRNA genes.\nAdvances by the DeLong group in cloning DNA directly from seawater provided\nthe landmark work that launched the ﬁeld (110). Development of metagenomic\nanalyses of soil was slower than with seawater because of the technical challenges\nof cloning DNA from the complex matrix of soil, which contains many compounds\nthat bind to DNA or inhibit the enzymatic reactions required for cloning. Signiﬁ-\ncant progress has been made, producing libraries that have substantially advanced\nunderstanding the functions in the soil community (96). The past eight years have\nwitnessed an explosion of interest and activity in metagenomics, accompanied by\nadvances in technology that have facilitated studies at a scale that was not feasible\nwhen the ﬁeld began. For example, the seminal paper in 1996 by Stein et al. (110)\nreported the sequencing and reconstruction of a 40-kb fragment from an uncultured\nmarine archaeon, which was a major undertaking at the time. In 2004, Venter et al.\n(115) reported their attempt to sequence the entire metagenome of the Sargasso\nSea by obtaining over 1 million kb of nonredundant sequence. The advances in\nsequencing technology have expanded the approaches and questions that can be\n\nAnnu. Rev. Genet. 2004.38:525-552.

Metagenomic technology has been successful at all scales—it\nhas been used to study single genes (e.g., cellulases, 48), pathways (e.g., antibiotic\nsynthesis, 96), organisms (e.g., Archaea, 110), and communities (e.g., acid mine\ndrainage bioﬁlm, 114). Approaches that involve massive sequencing to capture\nentire communities will likely become more common with further advances in\nsequencing technology.\n\nLINKING PHYLOGENY AND FUNCTION\nWITHIN SPECIES\n\nPhylogenetic Anchors\n\nThe ﬁrst metagenomic studies aimed to link a function with its phylogenetic source,\nproviding information about one species within a community. One of the challenges\nwith this approach is to link a phenotype with the identity of the original host. Three\napproaches have been taken: Screen a metagenomic library for a phenotype and\nthen attempt to determine the phylogenetic origin of the cloned DNA (Table 1),\nscreen clones for a speciﬁc phylogenetic anchor (e.g., 16S rRNA) or gene and then\nsequence the entire clone and search for genes of interest among the genes ﬂanking\nthe anchor (Table 2), or sequence the entire metagenome and identify interesting\ngenes and phylogenetic anchors in the resulting reconstructed genomes (Table 3).\n\nFunction Then Phylogeny\n\nDiverse activities have been discovered by functional analysis of metagenomic\nlibraries. New antibiotics (11–14, 36, 68, 96, 119, 120), hydrolytic and degrada-\ntive enzymes (21, 48–50, 59, 60, 91, 96, 117), biosynthetic functions (31, 61),\nantibiotic resistance enzymes (22, 92), and membrane proteins (69) have been\nidentiﬁed. The diversity of functionally active clones discovered in metagenomic\nlibraries validates the use of functional screens as one means to characterize the\nlibraries. Antimicrobial screens have revealed new antibiotics such as terragine\n(119), turbomycin A and B (36), and acyl tyrosines (13), as well as previously\ndescribed antibiotics such as indirubin (68) and violacein (12). Most of these com-\npounds are structurally based on common cell substituents, such as amino acids,\nand none requires more than a few genes for its synthesis. The goal of identify-\ning new polyketide, macrolide, and peptide antibiotics (45) may require different\nmethods. Enhancing expression of genes in metagenomic libraries may lead to dis-\ncovery of a wider array of natural products. This will be accomplished by moving\nthe libraries into alternative hosts, such as Streptomyces, which was the basis for\ndiscovery of terragine (119). Alternative hosts may enhance gene expression or\nprovide starting materials that Escherichia coli does not contain. E. coli can be en-\ngineered to express a wider range of functions by introducing genes encoding new\nsigma factors, rare tRNAs, or functions required to synthesize starting materials\n\nAnnu. Rev.

Alternatively, sequences that\ncarry conserved regions of genes associated with antibiotic biosynthesis, such as\nthe polyketide synthases and peptide synthetases, may be identiﬁed by sequenced-\nbased screens that do not require heterologous gene expression. This approach\nsuccessfully identiﬁed clones carrying a novel hybrid polyketide synthase-peptide\nsynthetase gene cluster from an uncultured bacterial symbiont of a beetle (81).\n\nNovel enzymes have been revealed in metagenomic libraries by screening\nclones directly for activity (49, 50, 96). Pigments have been identiﬁed by visual\ninspection (12, 36, 68). These methods require handling individual clones, usually\nin an array format. Because the frequency of active clones is low, high-throughput\nmethods are essential for efﬁcient screening. Selection for the ability to grow on\nhydroxyl-butyrate as the sole carbon and nitrogen source provided a powerful\nselection for clones carrying new degradative enzymes (49), and selection for an-\ntibiotic resistance identiﬁed new antibiotic resistance determinants from soil (22,\n92) and from oral ﬂora (27).\n\nLinking new functions with the organisms from which they were cloned will\nfacilitate ecological inferences and may lead to culturing strategies for uncultured\nspecies. Several approaches have been used to identify the phylogenetic origin\nof functionally active clones. First, to determine which phylogenetic groups are\nrepresented in a metagenomic library, 16S rRNA gene libraries have been con-\nstructed using DNA from the metagenomic library as the template for PCR (43,\n63, 68, 96, 117).

Conclusions from these analyses must be treated\ncautiously because horizontal gene transfer and the lack of functional homologues\nin the database may confound the results, leading to matches in ﬂanking DNA\noriginating in two different phyla (48). However, the presence of many cloned\ngenes on a clone that all show similarity to genes from related organisms can bol-\nster phylogenetic claims. Analyses of G + C content and codon usage within the\nregion of interest and the ﬂanking gene sequences may suggest the phylogenetic\norigin of the cloned DNA, although this approach has not been widely successful\nto date (19).\n\nConcerted effort devoted to ﬁnding clones carrying phylogenetic anchors from the\nleast known taxons has produced impressive collections of clones derived from\nsome of these groups. Sequence analysis of the DNA that ﬂanks phylogenetically\ninformative genes has provided the ﬁrst glimpses into the genetic potential of taxa\nthat contain no cultured members (Table 2). rRNA genes are the most widely\nused anchors (6, 9, 43, 63, 64, 84, 85, 102, 110, 116), and radA/recA homologues\n(100) have been informative as well. Other genes that contain phylogenetic in-\nformation but have not been used in metagenomic analyses include DNA gyrase\n(125), chaperonin-60 (38, 51, 108), RNA polymerase β-subunit (24, 73), ATPase\nβ-subunit (67), elongation factor TU (67), heat shock protein 70 (41), σ 70-type\nsigma factor (42), and tRNA synthetases (122, 123). The phylogenetic anchor ap-\nproach has been a rich source of information that can be used to develop hypotheses\nabout the function and physiology of uncultured members of microbial commu-\nnities that were previously known only by their 16S rRNA gene signature. Use\nof more phylogenetic anchors will increase the frequency of functionally active\nclones that also contain anchors.\n\nA consistent result of most studies that initially screen for a phylogenetic an-\nchor is the identiﬁcation of a large number of ORFs that are either hypothetical\nor have no known function. Initially, this information does little to describe the\nniche that the organism ﬁlls in the environment, but the sequence provides G + C\ncontent, codon usage, promoter sites, and other characteristics that may be help-\nful in achieving expression of genes from phyla with no cultured representatives.\nThese sequences also enrich the databases, offering insight subsequently when the\nfunction is determined for a homologue of the same gene family.\n\nAcidobacterium Phylogeny and Function\n\nGenomic information about uncultured bacteria may hasten development of media\nfor their culture (5, 18, 63, 85, 116).

This phylum has been divided into eight groups (4, 54). Janssen et al.\n(56, 99) have made tremendous advances in culturing members of the phylum,\nalthough all cultured members are from three of the eight groups.\n\nMetagenomics has provided the ﬁrst information beyond 16S rRNA gene se-\nquences about the uncultured Acidobacterium subgroups based on partial and\nfull-length sequencing of six fosmid clones (∼35 kb each; 85) and 12 BAC clones\n(25 kb; 63) from uncultured soil Acidobacterium members. Two of the clones are\nfrom members of Acidobacterium Group III, ﬁve are from Group V, and 11 are\nfrom Group VI. These clones provide a preliminary indication that the Acidobac-\nterium phylum contains substantial genetic diversity. Among the Group V clones,\nfor example, the G + C content of one is 56% and the other four range from 62%\nto 68%, while the one cultured member of this group, A. capsulatum, has a G + C\ncontent of 60%. Some of the metagenomic clones that afﬁliate with the Acidobac-\nterium phylum have been fully sequenced, revealing many genes with homology\nto housekeeping genes involved in DNA repair, transport, cell division, transla-\ntion, and purine biosynthesis. Other gene sequences include those with homology\nto genes encoding cyclic β 1(cid:2)-2(cid:2) glucan synthetase, polyhydroxybutyrate depoly-\nmerase, Bacteroides fragilis aerotolerance functions, and an operon distantly re-\nlated to the lincomycin biosynthesis pathway of Streptomyces lincolnensis (85),\nwhich provide hints about ecological roles of the Acidobacteria.\n\nTen of the 22 ORFs on one Acidobacterium fosmid clone showed homology\nto genes from members of the Rhizobiales within the α-Proteobacteria phylum\n(85). Comparison of the fosmid sequence to the gene sequences from Rhodopseu-\ndomonas palustris and Bradyrhizobium japonicum, Quaiser et al. (85) revealed\na colinear 10-kb region containing eight ORFs, which had homology to genes\nencoding a penicillin-binding protein, zinc metalloprotease, hydroxybutyrate de-\npolymerase, and a highly conserved two-component histidine kinase response reg-\nulator. A phylogenetic analysis of the response regulator indicated that one gene\nafﬁliated within the Rhizobiales and the second gene afﬁliated with other groups\nin the α-Proteobacteria. This 10-kb region was contiguous to an Acidobacterium-\ntype rrn operon, suggesting that this region might be the product of horizontal\ngene transfer (85).\n\nArchaeal Phylogeny and Function\n\nJust as culture-independent methods recalibrated thinking about the dominant or-\nganisms in soil, indicating that the Acidobacteria were far more abundant than\nhad been established by culturing, the discovery of 16S rRNA gene sequences\nthat afﬁliate with the Archaea in diverse terrestrial and marine environments on\nEarth has signiﬁcantly altered the microbiologist’s image of Archaea.

Six clones produced in fosmids, cosmids, or BACs, which contain\n16S rRNA genes that afﬁliate with the Archaea, have been sequenced.\n\nA particularly fruitful application of metagenomics to Archaea has been the\nstudy of the symbiotic community of an Axinella sp. sea sponge (100, 101, 103).\nIn a culture-independent 16S rRNA gene survey, Preston et al. (83) found that\n65% of the symbiotic community associated with the sponge was represented by a\nsingle archaeal 16S rRNA gene sequence. They proposed the name Cenarchaeum\nsymbiosum for the uncultured archaeal symbiont. Schleper et al. (101, 103) then\nconstructed fosmid libraries of the prokaryotic community and identiﬁed 15 unique\nclones that harbored 16S rRNA genes.\n\nAnalysis of the 15 clones revealed genetic variation within the C. symbiosum\npopulation and provided insight into the role of the population within the sponge\n(101). After identifying two 16S rRNA sequence variants that differed by two\npoint mutations over a 590-bp region, they sequenced one fosmid clone from each\nvariant. The 16S genes of the two clones were 99.2% identical while the 28-kb\ncolinear region that they shared had 87.8% overall DNA identity, and 91.6% simi-\nlarity in ORF amino acid sequence. Of the 17 ORFs in the 28-kb region shared by\nthe two variants, eight had no known function, and the others had functions related\nto heme and menaquinone biosynthesis, glycolysis, DNA replication and repair,\nprotein folding, and DNA methylation. The DNA polymerase found in this region\nwas expressed and characterized in an E. coli host (103). The complete genome\nsequence of C. symbiosum will contribute to understanding its biology and symbi-\notic relationship with its sponge host. There is precedent for this in the symbiosis\nbetween the aphid Baizongia pistacea and the bacterium Buchnera aphidicola.\nB. aphidicola is found in pure culture as an endosymbiont of its host. The complete\ngenome sequence for the bacterium revealed a complex biochemical symbiosis be-\ntween the partners in which each partner had lost biochemical functions that the\nother conducted for both of them (112). The B. aphidicola system illustrates the\npower of genomics to elucidate the biology of uncultured microorganisms.\n\nProteorhodopsin Function and Phylogeny\n\nDiscovery of the rhodopsin-like photoreceptors in marine Bacteria exempliﬁes the\ntype of biological surprise that can be revealed through metagenomic analysis.\nPreviously, rhodopsins had been found only in Archaea, not in members of the do-\nmain Bacteria. B´ej`a et al. (5) sequenced a 130-kb fragment that contained the 16S\nrRNA operon of an uncultured γ -Proteobacterium (the SAR 86 group) and dis-\ncovered a bacteriorhodopsin, which indicated a novel taxon of marine phototroph.\nThe bacteriorhodopsins couple light-energy harvesting with carbon-cycling in the\nocean through nonchlorophyll-based pathways, and the new homologue was ex-\npressed in E. coli and shown to bind retinal and form an active, light-driven,\nproton pump. Subsequent studies showed that many marine Proteobacteria harbor\n“proteorhodopsins,” that are optimized for various light wavelengths at different\n\nAnnu. Rev. Genet. 2004.38:525-552.

This line of research was successful at show-\ning that bacteria that harbor proteorhodopsin variants are widespread, and recent\nwork by Venter et al.

Most environments contain com-\nmunities far too complex for it to be possible to sequence a complete metagenome,\nand even the simple communities contain microheterogeneity that makes most\ngenome reconstructions simpliﬁed versions of reality. However, it is useful to re-\nfer to a metagenome, just as it is useful to refer to the human genome, although it\nis widely recognized that the true human genome is far more complex and variable\nthan the published genomic sequence, which is based on a few of the 6 × 109\nmembers of the species. Reconstruction was initially pursued for viral commu-\nnities in the ocean and human feces (15, 16) and has since been attempted in an\nacid mine drainage (AMD) bioﬁlm (114) and the Sargasso Sea (115). The AMD\nbioﬁlm community was ideal for complete metagenome sequencing because 16S\nrRNA gene sequencing indicated that there were three bacterial and three archaeal\nspecies in the bioﬁlm. Marine communities contain far greater species richness,\non the order of 100 to 200 species per ml of water (23), making the sequencing\nand assembly effort considerably more difﬁcult. Further out on the continuum\nof biological complexity is soil, with an estimated species richness on the or-\nder of 4000 species per gram of soil (23, 113). Sequencing the soil metagenome\nrequires faster and less expensive sequencing technology than currently avail-\nable. Meanwhile, soil metagenomics continues to focus on targeted biological\nquestions, thereby elucidating a slice of the community’s function by genomic\nanalysis.\n\nMetagenomic Analysis of Bacteriophage\n\nMicrobial communities are dominated by bacteria, and bacterial populations are\ndominated by bacteriophage. Bacteriophages inﬂuence the diversity and popula-\ntion structure of microbial communities (124). Like their bacterial counterparts,\nmost bacteriophages have never been studied in the laboratory because they rep-\nresent staggering diversity (95), and many of their hosts have not been cultured.\nComplete viral genome sequences are also necessary for viral phylogeny studies\nsince there is no equivalent to the 16S rRNA gene for virus phylogeny. Using\nmetagenomic analyses, two recent studies examined phage diversity of the human\ngut and marine environments.\n\nAnnu. Rev. Genet. 2004.38:525-552.

To investigate the phage population in the human gut, Breit-\nbart et al. (15) conducted a metagenomic analysis of the viral community in human\nfeces. They constructed a library containing random fragments of viral DNA from\na preparation of virus particles isolated from a 500-g human fecal sample, end-\nsequenced 532 clones, and found that 59% of them did not contain signiﬁcant\nsimilarity to previously reported sequences. The viral community contains ap-\nproximately 1200 genotypes, which probably outnumber the bacterial species in\nthe human intestine. The viral community may affect community structure by in-\nfecting and lysing particular members of the bacterial community and enhancing\nits diversity by mediating genetic exchange between bacteria.\n\nIn another study, Breitbart et al. (16) described a metagenomic analysis of\nmarine phage collected at two locations. In total, almost 2000 viral sequences\nwere obtained. The results suggest that the phage populations differed between\nthe two marine locations and between the marine and fecal samples. For instance,\nT7-like podophages comprised over 30% of the marine phage types (16) and less\nthan 6% of the fecal phage types (15). The predominance of gram-positive bacteria\nin the gut and gram-negative bacteria in seawater is at least partly responsible for\nthe substantial difference in viral communities.\n\nMetagenome of the Microbial Community\nin Acid Mine Drainage\n\nAcid mine drainage results from bacterial iron oxidation, which leads to acidiﬁca-\ntion due to dissolution of pyrite in abandoned mines (29). The microbial bioﬁlm\ngrowing in the AMD in the Richmond mine at Iron Mountain, California, has a\npH of 0.83, temperature of 43◦C, and high concentrations of Fe, Zn, Cu, and As\n(114). Sequences of the 5(cid:2) and 3(cid:2) ends of 384 16S rRNA genes obtained from the\nbioﬁlm revealed members of Leptospirillum groups II and III, Sulfobacillus sp.,\nFerroplasma sp., “A-plasma,” and “G-plasma.” There are also protists containing\nRickettsiales-type endosymbiotic bacteria (3).\n\nMETAGENOME RECONSTRUCTION Ferroplasma acidarmanus fer1, an archeon in\nthe mine has been grown in pure culture, and its genome has been sequenced,\nalthough attempts to grow other members of the community in culture have been\nunsuccessful. To sequence the genomes of the uncultured Bacteria and Archaea in\nthe bioﬁlm, Tyson et al. (114) extracted DNA directly from the bioﬁlm, constructed\na small insert library (average insert size of 3.2 kb), and obtained 76.2 Mbp of se-\nquence data from 103,462 reads. They partitioned the community into populations\nand identiﬁed ﬁve sequence “bins”: high G + C scaffolds with 3x and 10x cover-\nage, low G + C scaffolds with 3x and 10x coverage, and short scaffolds with poor\ncoverage. Each of the four bins with greater than 3x coverage contained a single\n16S rRNA gene fragment, enabling them to assign a phylogenetic identity to each\nbin with conﬁdence. Based on this analysis, they obtained near-complete genome\n\nAnnu. Rev. Genet. 2004.38:525-552. Downloaded from www.annualreviews.orgby Georgetown University on 03/22/13.

(114) set out to\ndetermine the ecological role of each of the ﬁve prokaryotes in the acid mine\ndrainage. Genes that would enable most of the organisms to ﬁx carbon via the\nreductive acetyl coenzyme A pathway were identiﬁed within each of the genome\nsequences. Based on the many genes in the Ferroplasma type I and II genomes that\nhave signiﬁcant similarity to sugar and amino acid transporters, they predicted that\nthese Ferroplasma spp. preferred a heterotrophic lifestyle. The only N2 ﬁxation\ngenes that were identiﬁed in the metagenome belonged to the genome of the Lep-\ntospirillum group III population. Because of its specialized role in the environment\nand relatively low abundance (10%), Leptospirillum group III was proposed as a\nkeystone species. They tested and supported this hypothesis by isolating Leptospir-\nillum group III in pure culture from a N2-based enrichment (J.F. Banﬁeld, personal\ncommunication). Other genes that are potentially responsible for microaerophilic\nsurvival, bioﬁlm formation, acid tolerance, and metal resistance were observed.\n\nMany of the hypotheses suggested in the AMD study will be evaluated by con-\nstructing microarrays and developing new techniques for isolating the uncultured\nprokaryotes (114). The simplicity of the community and the differences in G +\nC content of its members facilitated the powerful genomic reconstruction in the\nAMD bioﬁlm. The genomics, coupled with keen insight into the chemistry of the\nenvironment, produced inferences and hypotheses that will lead to future studies\nto culture each of the community’s members and unravel the complex interactions\nthat produce this extreme environment.\n\nMetagenome of the Microbial Community in the Sargasso Sea\n\nVenter et al. (115) conducted a massive sequencing project focused on the mi-\ncrobiota of the nutrient-limited Sargasso Sea, an intensively studied marine en-\nvironment. Two million random sequences yielded over 1.6 billion base pairs of\nsequence information, including approximately 1.0 billion base pairs of nonredun-\ndant sequence.\n\nBIOGEOCHEMISTRY Although the interpretation of this huge dataset has barely be-\ngun, new insights into the biogeochemistry of marine ecosystems have emerged.\nFirst, contrary to the entrenched dogma that oceanic nitriﬁcation is mediated by\nbacteria, the authors identiﬁed an archaeal scaffold that contains an ammonium\nmonooxygenase. Second, among the sequences derived from the phosphorus-\nlimited Sargasso Sea are genes thought to be involved in uptake of phosphorus\nin various forms; these include polyphosphates, pyrophosphates, phosphonates,\nand other inorganic phosphorus. These results augment a relatively thin literature\nabout the phosphorus cycle. Compared with the ﬁve other major elements (C,\nN, O, H, S), relatively little is known about how phosphorus enters biological\nsystems and changes oxidation state. Therefore, examining a phosphorus-limited\n\nAnnu. Rev. Genet. 2004.38:525-552. Downloaded from www.annualreviews.orgby Georgetown University on 03/22/13.

The Sargasso Sea study provides the basis for functional studies to determine\nhow these phosphorus acquisition genes are deployed to promote survival in a\nphosphorus-deﬁcient community.\n\nGENOME ORGANIZATION AND RECONSTRUCTION Overlapping sequences were\nassembled into scaffolds and then sorted into tentative “organism bins” based\non three criteria: oligonucleotide frequencies, read depth, and similarity to previ-\nously sequenced genomes. Due to the immense microbial diversity of the Sargasso\nSea, relatively few complete microbial genomes were assembled, despite the large\namount of sequence data accumulated. When “reconstructing” genomes from the\nenvironment, care must be taken not to generate chimeric genomes that do not exist\nin nature. Venter et al. (115) set a good standard for the ﬁeld by making the trace\nﬁles of individual sequences available so that others can check the validity of the as-\nsembled scaffolds or reanalyze the data as sequence assembly algorithms improve.\nIn comparison to culture-independent methods that are based on individual\ngenes (usually 16S rRNA), large-scale sequencing of environmental genomes pro-\nvides insights into microbial diversity at much higher resolution. Unlike traditional\ngenome sequencing projects, which start with a homogeneous clonal population,\nenvironmental samples are likely to contain multiple strains of any given species\n(or phylotype). Heterogeneity makes the accurate assembly of discrete genomes\ndifﬁcult, but the sequences offer unprecedented opportunities to understand evo-\nlutionary events within natural microbial populations.\n\nIMPACT ON PUBLIC DATABASES The vast amount of data from the Sargasso Sea\nstudy contribute to metagenomics and microbial ecology, providing the largest ge-\nnomic dataset for any community on Earth. But the data have also skewed genomic\nanalysis: As of April 1, 2004, 5% of GenBank was from the Sargasso Sea scaffold\ncollection. A BLAST analysis of one sequence read from their collection against\nGenBank will often identify 50 similar DNA fragments of no known function that\nare all from the Sargasso Sea, making annotation laborious. It might be useful for\nusers of GenBank to have the option to exclude or include environmental DNA\nsequences from their searches, just as users of the Human EST database can se-\nlect sublibraries to search. It is critical that users of the databases are aware that\nﬁnding matches to sequences from the Sargasso Sea is more likely to be due to the\nabundance of sequences from this study than to ecological similarities.\n\nCHALLENGES WITH METAGENOMIC ANALYSIS\n\nPhylogenetic Anchors\n\nThe ideal phylogenetic anchor would be equally represented in all species. The 16S\nrRNA genes do not meet this standard because microorganisms differ in the number\nof rrn operons they carry in their genomes, with a range of 1 to 15 (58). If the number\n\nAnnu. Rev.

Once genomes have been reconstructed, one rrn operon per genome\nis sufﬁcient to determine the phylogenetic afﬁliation of the source of the genes\nin the genome, but in the absence of metagenome reconstruction for an entire\nenvironment, phylogenetic anchors that are found at frequent intervals in genomes\nare essential. When it is not possible to identify a 16S rRNA gene, another anchor is\nneeded.\n\nAn alternative to ﬁnding phylogenetic anchors on a DNA fragment encoding a\nfunction of interest is to ﬁnd fragments of the genome that are linked to the one\nof interest and search for phylogenetic anchors on them. This method increases\nthe effective size of the contiguous piece of DNA that is being analyzed without\nrequiring an increase in the size of the inserts in the library. To ﬁnd fragments that\nare linked in a simple community, a library with high redundancy is needed. The\nclones can be blotted on a membrane and then probed with the clone of interest to\nidentify those that have an end overlapping with it (110) or clones can be screened\nby PCR for overlapping regions (84). Neither of these methods has been reported\nas successful, but this is an area of rapid development and functional methods will\nlikely be established in the future.\n\nConstructing metagenomic libraries from environmental samples is conceptu-\nally simple but technically challenging. If seawater contains 200 species per\nml (23), then the metagenome would contain 1 Gbp of unique DNA. To ob-\ntain greater than single sequencing coverage, the size of a metagenomic library\nwould need to be many times the size of the metagenome. Because members\nof a community are not equally represented, it is likely that a metagenomic\nlibrary of minimum coverage would only represent the genomes of the most\nabundant species. To obtain substantial representation of rare members (<1%)\nof the community, the library would likely need to contain 100- to 1000-fold\ncoverage of the metagenome. A library of 500 Gbp might be required to capture\nthe species richness in 1 ml of seawater. Cloning the metagenome of soil, with\na species richness 20-fold higher than seawater (23), would be a considerably\nmore daunting prospect (10,000 Gbp). These examples illustrate several chal-\nlenges in constructing and interpreting information from metagenomic libraries:\n(a) a large amount of DNA must be isolated and cloned from a small sample,\n(b) many clones and sequences must be processed to provide meaningful data, and\n(c) lognormal-type population distributions make it difﬁcult to represent the minor\nspecies from a sample. Each of these challenges is being addressed, and several\nstudies evaluating methods for library construction have been published (10, 33, 34,\n37, 44).\n\nSize of Metagenomes\n\nAnnu. Rev.

Libraries containing large DNA fragments are constructed in\nlambda phage, cosmid, fosmid, and BAC vectors. Most of the reported large-\ninsert metagenomic libraries contain fewer than 100,000 clones (Tables 1 and 2)\nand are several orders of magnitude too small to capture the entire microbial diver-\nsity present in the complex communities they represent. Although increasing the\nlibrary size is a worthy goal, existing libraries have provided useful insights into the\nmicrobial ecology of several ecosystems in the absence of complete metagenome\ncoverage.\n\nSmall-insert libraries have a signiﬁcant advantage over large insert libaries be-\ncause to obtain small inserts the microorganisms can be lysed by harsh methods\nthat would shear DNA too much to obtain large inserts. Bead beating, for example,\nextracts DNA from diverse Bacteria and Archaea, providing a good representa-\ntion of the community. Small-insert libraries are not useful for capturing complex\npathways requiring many genes, but they provide an appropriate resource for dis-\ncovery of new metabolic functions encoded by single genes and for reconstructing\nmetagenomes (114, 115). The past reconstruction studies, however, did not take\nadvantage of the harsh lysis methods that are accommodated by small-insert li-\nbrary construction, instead using chemical lysis, which does not access DNA from\nas diverse a group of organisms. Although both reconstruction studies reported\nsequences from Archaea, which are notoriously difﬁcult to lyse, the Sargasso Sea\nstudy did not report members of the phyla containing only uncultured organisms,\nso the effect of the DNA extraction on the diversity of DNA in the metagenomic\nlibraries method remains unclear.\n\nThe two metagenome reconstruction studies illustrate the difﬁculty in repre-\nsenting all of the members of a community in the library. For example, ﬁve species\nwere identiﬁed within the AMD metagenome and the two archaeal Ferroplasma\nand Leptospirillum spp. were represented similarly in the metagenomic libraries,\nalthough ﬂuorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) showed that the Leptospirillum\nspp. represented 85% of the community (114). The discrepancy between FISH\nand genome-sequencing data suggests that there may be a cloning bias, which\nis advantageous for this application because it led to high representation in the\nlibrary of minor members of the community. In the Sargasso Sea study (115),\nthe genomes of ﬁve species were represented with more than 3x coverage in the\nlibraries, but the seawater contains an estimated 1800 species, suggesting that at\nleast ﬁve of the species are far more abundant than others, illustrating the limitation\nof metagenomics in providing access to rare community members.\n\nAs with any genomics study, gene product toxicity is a concern in metagenomic\nanalyses. However, a high-copy vector was used to construct the AMD metage-\nnomic library (114), and the small number of gaps suggests little impact on the\ncomposition of the library. High-copy vectors are useful because it is easier to ob-\ntain sufﬁcient DNA for further analysis, and for this reason, several plasmids that\n\nAnnu. Rev. Genet. 2004.38:525-552.

These plasmids can be maintained at low copy during clone isolation to avoid\ntoxicity and then can be ampliﬁed for screening or plasmid isolation.\n\nIdentifying Sequences of Interest in\nLarge Metagenomic Libraries\n\nThe library size required to obtain sufﬁcient coverage of the metagenome of even\nthe simplest community presents a signiﬁcant challenge for screening. Brute-force\nsequencing (114, 115) has provided tremendous insight into the libraries and the\ncommunities from which they were derived, but the information gleaned from\nsequencing is limited by the annotation of genes in the existing databases and the\navailable sequencing capacity. In the Sargasso Sea study, only 35% of the genes\nidentiﬁed had signiﬁcant sequence similarity to genes in the public databases.\nFunctional screening has the potential to identify interesting genes that would\nnot be recognizable based on their sequences, but sequence-based screening can\nidentify sequences that would not be expressed in the host species carrying the\nlibrary. A combination of sequence-based methods and functional screening is\ncritical to advancing the ﬁeld because neither can deﬁne the full diversity of gene\nfunction in the libraries. High-throughput methods are needed to identify clones\ncarrying functionally active genes, phylogenetic anchors, and novel genes.\n\nFUNCTIONAL SCREENING Advances in screening for active clones will increase\nthe knowledge mined from metagenomic libraries. Key approaches will include\nnew selections that facilitate identiﬁcation of active clones from among millions of\nclones. Another productive approach is to construct reporter fusions that respond\nto expression of the genes of interest. If clones expressing the reporter can be\nidentiﬁed rapidly by selection for antibiotic resistance or ﬂuorescence-activated\ncell sorting, then libraries of sufﬁcient size to represent the diversity of a natu-\nral environment could be screened. Implementation of such screens will provide\ncomprehensive functional information that will complement complete sequencing\nof the metagenome.\n\nSEQUENCE-BASED SCREENING Screening libraries for genes of interest using\nprimers or probes based on conserved sequences identiﬁes homologues of known\ngenes. This has proved effective to identify phylogenetic anchors and genes en-\ncoding enzymes with highly conserved domains (81). A challenge associated with\nscreening libraries for clones carrying phylogenetic anchors is detecting the an-\nchor on the cloned DNA without detecting the homologue in the chromosome of\nthe host cell. This can be circumvented by using a vector with high or inducible\ncopy number (44). When the cloned gene is in 50-fold excess to the chromosomal\ncopy, the signal is sufﬁcient to detect. Alternatively, “terminator PCR” can be used\nto block ampliﬁcation of the host cell’s homologue.

These meth-\nods involve proﬁling clones with microarrays that identify previously unknown\ngenes in environmental samples (107), subtractive hybridization to eliminate all\nsequences that hybridize with another environment, or subtractive hybridization\nto identify differentially expressed genes (35), and genomic sequence tags (28).\nThese methods will enhance the efﬁciency of screening and aid in identifying\nminor components in communities and genes that deﬁne community uniqueness.\n\nINTEGRATING METAGENOMICS AND COMMUNITY\nECOLOGY\n\nMetagenomics is a powerful approach for exploring the ecology of complex mi-\ncrobial communities. Its power will be realized when it is integrated with classical\necological approaches and efforts to culture previously unculturable microorgan-\nisms, which will likely be facilitated by clues about the physiology of the uncultured\nmicroorganisms derived from metagenomic analysis. Microscopy and stable iso-\ntope analysis are two approaches that will be particularly informative when linked\nto metagenomics.\n\nMicroscopy\n\nMetagenomics complements direct observation of microorganisms in situ with\nFISH (1), RING-FISH (128), and FISH-MAR (62). Fluorescent in situ hybridiza-\ntion (FISH) is commonly used in microbial ecology studies to visualize microor-\nganisms that contain rRNA that hybridizes with a ﬂuorescently labeled probe, most\noften directed toward the 16S rRNA gene. Until recently, FISH has been limited\nto detection of highly expressed genes, such as the 16S rRNA genes, because\nit detects abundant RNA and not single-copy genes. To overcome this limita-\ntion, Zwirglmaier et al. (128) described an adaptation of FISH called RING-FISH\n(recognition of individual genes-FISH) that facilitates visualization of plasmid\nor chromosomal genes in situ by increasing the sensitivity of detection. Another\nvariation on FISH is to link it with microautoradiography to identify taxons that\nutilize particular substrates in natural microbial communities (40, 62, 76). Further\naugmentation of metagenomics with microscopy that can monitor genes, gene ex-\npression, and environmental conditions on a microscale will provide new insights\ninto the workings of microbial communities.\n\nStable Isotopes\n\nThe use of stable isotopes to understand cycling of elements in microbial com-\nmunities presents a singular opportunity in metagenomics.

Building metagenomic libraries from such communities\ncan be used either to determine which community members are metabolically ac-\ntive (using a labeled substrate such as glucose, which can be metabolized by many\norganisms) or which utilize the labeled substrate (using a specialized substrate,\nsuch as an environmental pollutant). The DNA from the fraction of the community\nthat used the labeled substrate will contain DNA with the stable isotope, making it\nseparable from unlabeled DNA by density centrifugation. Metagenomic libraries\nand 16S rRNA gene libraries can be constructed with the labeled DNA to enrich\nfor genes associated with the active species (71, 72, 74, 75, 86–88). Innovative\napproaches such as these will advance metagenomic analysis to the next level,\nlinking phylogeny and function more precisely.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nConstructing metagenomic libraries captures the phylogenetic and genetic diver-\nsity in environmental samples. Clones derived from one third of the 52 bacterial\nphyla have been reported, including representatives of several candidate phyla\nand most of the phyla that are particularly abundant in environmental samples but\nunderrepresented by cultured isolates (Table 4). The assessment of phylogenetic\ndiversity in metagenomic libraries underestimates the biodiversity because a small\nproportion of clones contain phylogenetic anchors, and the phylogenetic represen-\ntation of very few libraries has been characterized. The genetic potential of the\nlibraries has only begun to be tapped. The small molecules and enzymes already\ndiscovered indicate the potential of metagenomics to mine the environment for\nfundamental knowledge and products for biotechnology. But effective mining will\nrequire high-throughput functional screens and selections and rapid methods for\nidentifying sequences of interest. The advances in sequencing technology make it\npossible to accumulate vast amounts of DNA sequence, which has proved a pow-\nerful source of discovery, but more directed methods will lead to larger collections\nof genes of a particular type or function. Future advances in understanding the dif-\nferences among communities or environments will be derived from “comparative\nmetagenomics” in which libraries prepared from different sites or at different times\ncan be compared. Our knowledge of 1% of the microbial world through culturing\nmay be predictive of much that we will ﬁnd among the uncultured organisms, but\nabundant surprises await us in this unknown world.\n\nThe Annual Review of Genetics is online at http://genet.annualreviews.org\n\nLITERATURE CITED\n\n1.
