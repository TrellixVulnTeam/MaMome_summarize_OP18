Interventions
The treatment group received oral probiotic capsules con-
taining 2.5 billion CFUs each of L. rhamnosus GR-1and L.
reuteri RC-14, while the placebo group received identical
capsules containing excipients alone (Chr. Hansen, Hør-
sholm, Denmark). The contents of both capsules are stable
at room temperature, and enough capsules were provided
to each participant at the time of enrolment to last until
42 weeks’ gestation. We cultured the lactobacilli
from a
sample of the probiotic capsules before the start of the trial
to ensure they were viable and could be detected by our
culture techniques. Participants were instructed to take one
capsule daily until delivery and self-report compliance at
each study visit.25 Outcomes
Our primary outcome was the rate of BV at 18–20 weeks’
gestation, measured using the Nugent
(Nugent
score ≥7 shows presence of BV). Secondary outcomes were
vaginal colonisation rates at 18–20 weeks’ gestation of the
probiotic or other Lactobacillus spp., two common neonatal
pathogens (Escherichia coli and Group B streptococcus),
and the composition of the vaginal microbiota.

There were no differences in characteristics of partici-
pants between the two groups at baseline (Table 1). In a
random sample of probiotic capsules tested for Lactobacilli,
the mean count was 2 9 109 for L. rhamnosus GR-1 and
1 9 109
for L. reuteri RC-14. No other bacteria were detected. Self-reported compliance to the intervention at
18–20 weeks’ was 93% (114/123) in the probiotic group
and 98% (113/115) in the placebo group. No serious
adverse events related to the study interventions were
reported.

At 18–20 weeks’ gestation, the rate of BV in the probi-
otic group was 15% (19/123) compared with 9% (10/115)
in the placebo group. There were no differences between
the groups
in the rates of vaginal colonisation with
L. rhamnosus GR-1 (5%, 6/123 and 5%, 6/115), E. coli
(23.6%, 29/123 and 25.2%, 29/115) or Group B strepto-
cocci (4%, 5/123 and 8%, 9/115). Vaginal colonisation with
L. reuteri RC-14 was not detected in either
group
(Table 1). After adjusting for Nugent score at baseline,
there were no differences between the groups in the odds
of BV (adjusted OR 1.82, 95% CI 0.64–5.19; P = 0.26).

Participants (n = 152) who attended at all time-points
were selected for the microbiome analysis. PCR ampliﬁca-
tion at baseline failed in two participants in each group,
and the 18–20 weeks’ gestation swabs from three partici-
pants were unavailable, leaving 147 participants who pro-
vided 299 samples (75 in each group at baseline, and 74
and 75 in the probiotic and placebo groups, respectively, at
18–20 weeks’). The 16S rRNA genes were successfully
ampliﬁed and sequenced from these, and 6714 sequence
reads were sub-sampled from each sample. The composi-
tion of the vaginal community was as expected, with sub-
sets dominated by Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus 4 ª 2019 The Authors. BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of

terised by a diverse community, which included anaerobic
species and Gardnerella vaginalis (Figure 3).

Discussion The aim of this trail was to compare the effects on the
vaginal microbiota of oral probiotic capsules containing
L. rhamnosus GR-1 and L. reuteri RC-14 versus placebo
taken orally from early pregnancy until delivery. The bio-
logical effects were measured by Nugent scoring and cul-
three time points
ture of vaginal samples collected at
during pregnancy.

Main ﬁndings
The oral administration of L. rhamnosus GR-1 and L. reu-
teri RC-14 daily from early pregnancy did not affect the
prevalence of BV or common neonatal pathogens, or alter the composition of the vaginal microbiota at 18–20 weeks’
gestation. Previous observational studies and small-scale
randomised controlled trials in non-pregnant populations
have suggested that oral administration of probiotics can
alter the vaginal microbiota in a signiﬁcant number of
women where microbial imbalance exists.18–21 It is on this
basis that several commercial probiotic products are mar-
keted for the restoration and maintenance of a healthy
vaginal microbiota in both non-pregnant and pregnant
women.19,20 Our ﬁndings have not shown any effect on the
vaginal microbiota with the probiotic preparation used in
this trial.

retention ensured internal validity, while the multicentre
recruitment and broad inclusion criteria enhanced external
validity. We used probiotics that are safe during pregnancy
and have been reported to colonise the vagina in some
non-pregnant women within 2 weeks of treatment.19 Before
the start of the study, we conﬁrmed the viability of the lac-
tobacilli in the probiotic capsules and that our laboratory
techniques would detect them in culture. Antibiotic pre-
scribing during pregnancy is common in the UK39 and we
took account of antibiotic exposure as a potential con-
founding variable. We did not take account of vaginal 6 ª 2019 The Authors. BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of

support conclusive evidence has been hampered by inadequacies in
trial design (for example sample size), variations in the
interventions strains that were used, in the outcome mea-
sures, mode of administration, and control of confounding
factors such as use of antibiotics and topical antimicrobials.

<12 weeks’ gestational age were allocated to once-daily oral
capsules of L. rhamnosus GR-1 or L. reuteri RC-14 or pla-
cebo for 8 weeks. No differences were found in the preva-
lence of BV assessed by Nugent score between probiotic
and placebo groups before (placebo group 5.4% versus
probiotic group 2.8%, P = 0.376) and after the intervention
