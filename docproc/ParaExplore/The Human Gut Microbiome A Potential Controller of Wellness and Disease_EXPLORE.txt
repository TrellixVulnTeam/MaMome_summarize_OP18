microbiota inhabiting us, namely protozoa, archaea, eukaryotes,
viruses and predominantly bacteria that live symbiotically on and
within various sites of the human body. Examples of occupied
habitats include our oral cavity, genital organs, respiratory tract,
skin and gastrointestinal system (Lloyd-Price et al., 2016). The
human microbiota is estimated to be ∼1013–1014 microbial
cells, with around 1:1 microbial cells to human cells ratio
(Sender et al., 2016). These numbers are derived from the
total bacterial cells in colon (3.8 × 1013 bacteria), the organ
that harbors the densest number of microbes (Sender et al.,
2016). The diverse gastrointestinal microbiota is predominantly
composed of bacteria from three major phyla, namely Firmicutes,
Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria (Tap et al., 2009). This diverse
and complex microbiome serves as a functional expansion of
host genomes, and is estimated to harbor 50- to 100-fold
more genes, compared to the host. These extra genes have
added various types of enzymatic proteins which were non-
encoded by the host, and play a critical role in facilitating
host metabolism, thus contributing to the regulation of host
physiology (Hooper and Gordon, 2001). Until recent decades, the
properties of the human microbiome and the host–microbiota
interactions have been largely unknown due to technology
limitations especially in examining non-cultivable microbes
of interest, and lack of population-scale data depicting the
microbiota compositions and functions. However, advances in
sequencing technologies and subsequent large-scale sequence-

THE GUT MICROBIOME AND ITS
MULTIFARIOUS FUNCTIONS interactions The symbiotic relationship between the gut microbiota and
the host is regulated and stabilized by a complex network
of
immune, and
that encompass metabolic,
neuroendocrine crosstalk between them. This crosstalk is
potentially mediated by microbial-synthesized metabolites
which exhibit pleiotropic eﬀects, including acting as signaling
molecules in regulating host neuro-immune-inﬂammatory axes
that could physiologically link gut with other organ systems.
The predominant functions of gut microbiota and the associated
key metabolites in governing host wellness are depicted in the
following subsections, with some other microbial metabolites
being described in Table 1.

Besides SCFA, gut microbiota-synthesized micronutrients
such as vitamins exhibit beneﬁcial value for both microbial
and host metabolisms. Vitamin-K-producing gut bacteria
namely Bacteroides fragilis, Eubacterium lentum, Enterobacter
agglomerans, Serratia marcescens, and Enterococcus faecium
(Fernandez and Collins, 1987; Cooke et al., 2006) anaerobically
synthesize vitamin K2 (menaquinone) which is essential
in
decreasing vascular calciﬁcation, elevating HDL and lowering
cholesterol levels, contributing to lower risk of cardiovascular
disorders such as atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease
(Kawashima et al., 1997; Geleijnse et al., 2004). Gut microbiota
also serves as an important source of vitamins B for the host
(Salminen et al., 1998; Degnan et al., 2014). Among them,
vitamins B5 and B12, which are exclusively synthesized by
intestinal microbiota, act as coenzyme for extensive range of host
biochemical processes including production of acetylcholine and
cortisol which are required for normal functioning of the nervous
system. Deﬁciency of vitamins B5 and B12 have been linked to
several disorders such as gastrointestinal discomfort, insomnia,
neuropsychological and hematological disorders (Andres et al.,
2004; Gominak, 2016). However, the possible link between loss of
vitamin-producing gut microbiota and disease onset has not yet
been elucidated.

such as Clostridium perfringens Gut microbiota also plays an important role in the co-
metabolism of bile acids with the host. These cholesterol
derivatives are synthesized in the liver, followed by conjugation
with taurine or glycine prior to storage in the gall bladder
and subsequent secretion into duodenum to aid digestion,
cholesterol and lipid metabolisms. In humans, 95% of bile
acids are reabsorbed at distal ileum (Staels and Fonseca, 2009).
The 5% unabsorbed primary bile acids are then bioconverted
or deconjugated to secondary bile acids
(predominantly
DCA and LCA) by bile salt hydrolases secreted by several
and
colonic microbiota
Clostridium scindens, followed by partly colonic reabsorption
and transportation back to liver for conjugation (Gopal-
Srivastava and Hylemon, 1988; Ajouz et al., 2014) and the
unabsorbed secondary bile acids are excreted by the host (Sorg
and Sonenshein, 2008). Both primary and secondary bile acids
are able to activate host nuclear FXR signaling, which in turn
regulates the bile acids production, glucose metabolism, and
potentially hepatic autophagy (Lee et al., 2014; Nie et al., 2015).
Secondary bile acids serve as a potent activator of TGR5 (a
member of the Rhodopsin-like subfamily of GPCRs) which is
widely expressed on diﬀerent tissues including in gall bladder,
liver, spleen,
intestine, and the immune cells. Such GPCR
activation will stimulate second messenger c-AMP production,
and the subsequent c-AMP-dependent downstream signaling,
inducing expressions of a multitude of genes, whereby its
physiological importance remains to be fully elucidated, pointing
toward impacts of secondary bile acid-TCR5 axis (Hylemon
et al., 2009). Secondary bile acids also possess antimicrobial
eﬀects which alter microbial cell membrane integrity, causing
spillage of intracellular contents, thus inhibiting growth of bile
acid-intolerant microbes (Nie et al., 2015).
