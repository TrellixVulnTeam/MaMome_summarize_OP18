Grier et al. Microbiome  (2017) 5:158  Page 2 of 19 infant nutrition, and common clinical practices in neonatal
care [14–20]. We hypothesize that assembly and function
of the preterm infants’ gut microbiota is associated with
postnatal growth patterns and represents a yet unexplored
personalized therapeutic potential for optimizing infant
development.

Development of the premature infant gut microbiota
has recently been shown to evolve in a patterned pro-
gression associated with postmenstrual age (PMA; gesta-
tional age at birth plus week of
life), dominated by
Bacilli at early PMA, followed by Gammaproteobacteria
and then Clostridia [5]. In our study, we introduce two
models to identify associations between the microbiota,
nutritional intake, medication, and preterm infant growth:
a categorical model based on three quantitatively defined
“phases” (P1, P2, and P3) that corresponds to three states
of the microbiota and a PMA-based model with the three
composition-based phases replaced by two constant time
periods identified as early (< 34 weeks PMA; n = 362 data
points) and late (≥ 34 weeks PMA; n = 343 data points).
Our analyses identified more significant associations with
phase, which led us to use the phase-based framework to
explore potential functional relationships between the pre-
term microbiota, nutrition, and growth.

We first defined the phases and phase transition points
in longitudinal gut microbiota samples from two cohorts
of preterm and full-term infants from the multicenter
Prematurity and Respiratory Outcomes Program (PROP)
and Respiratory Pathogens Research Center (RPRC) at the
University of Rochester School of Medicine. The distin-
guishing composition and putative functional capacity of
each phase was assessed, along with the properties of tran-
sitions between phases. Our data suggest phase-specific
microbiota functions and demonstrate the effect of nutri-
tional intake and clinical factors on phase and period-
specific microbiota development. Furthermore, our results
in-
indicate significant associations between nutritional
take, the phase of the microbiota, and preterm infant
growth. Finally, we demonstrate that transition out of
phase 1 (P1) occurs simultaneously with transition from
meconium to normal postnatal stool, a milestone that can
be unambiguously identified at the bedside.

Results
Overview of preterm infant cohort
Our study examined associations between preterm infant
PMA, growth, nutrition, clinical factors, and gut microbiota development in a cohort of 95 preterm and 2 full-term in-
fants from PROP and 23 full-term infants from RPRC at
the University of Rochester School of Medicine. A total of
719 rectal swab samples were collected weekly from the
PROP preterm infants while in the NICU, spanning PMA
from 24 to 46 weeks with a good representation across ges-
tational ages. A total of 2 rectal swabs were collected from
the 2 PROP full-term infants, and 46 rectal swabs from the
23 RPRC full-term infants: one near birth (≤ 20 day of life
[DOL]) and—for the RPRC subjects only—a second at
1 month of age (20 < DOL ≤ 50) (Table 1). The longitudinal
analyses included 719 samples from preterm and 48
samples from full-term infants. Relevant available age
metrics were gestational age at birth, day of
life
(DOL), and PMA. To select the age metric for our
analyses, we used functional data analysis to fit nutri-
tion and growth variables, as well as the abundance of
operational taxonomic units (OTUs)
in the micro-
biota, first using PMA and then DOL as the age vari-
able [21]. The overall fitting variance using PMA was
lower for OTU abundance and, for most metrics of
growth and nutrition, consistent with previous findings
that the temporal dynamics of the preterm infant gut
microbiota correspond better to PMA than to DOL [5].

c Medication received within 1 week prior to microbiome sample collection.
Sample collection occurred approximately weekly throughout the majority of
the hospitalization as clinically permitted. If the interval between samples was
greater than 7 days apart, then short portions of the hospital stay are not
covered by this analysis. Therefore, subjects who had the respective
medication, but not within 1 week prior to sample collection, are not counted
in this summary table 13 24 Grier et al. Microbiome  (2017) 5:158  Page 3 of 19 Consequently, we used gestational age at birth and PMA
for our analyses.

We quantified the pattern of progression of the gut
microbiota with respect to the order of phase transition
events using the sequence of phases observed in the
consecutive samples from each individual infant to com-
pute the transition probabilities between the phases. For
each phase, the probability that the subsequent sample
from the same individual will be in the same phase is
higher than the probability of transitioning to a different
phase (Fig. 1d). Transition from one phase to the next
consecutive phase is more likely than the transition from
a higher phase to a lower phase (e.g., P2 to P1) or from
P1 to P3 directly. Accordingly, we found a strong rela-
tionship between PMA and microbiota phases (Fig. 1e).
For this preterm cohort, 70% of all P1 samples were
observed at PMA of 29 weeks or less; 84% of all P2
samples were observed from 28 weeks to 36 weeks
PMA; and 78% of all P3 samples at 33 weeks or later.
Eighty six percent of all samples from 37 weeks PMA
and later were in P3, suggesting that preterm infant Grier et al. Microbiome  (2017) 5:158  Page 4 of 19 CC CB CG C 0.013 0.091 0.896 Klebsiella Enterobacteriaceae* Enterobacteriaceae* Finegoldia

(Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States) [63]. Each gray panel corresponds to one function and each
point within a gray panel represents one sample. The samples are stratified by phase along the x axis, with red circles corresponding to P1,
orange triangles corresponding to P2, and green squares corresponding to P3 samples. The sample position on the y axis indicates the relative
abundance of the specified KEGG pathway, calculated as the fraction of times functional components of that pathway occurs across all organisms
in the sample, with the contribution of each organism weighted by its relative abundance. Within each phase, samples are plotted on top of a
box plot, which is centered on the median, with notches indicating an approximately 95% confidence interval, boxes indicating the boundaries
of the first and third quartiles, and whiskers extending to the largest and smallest values no further than 1.5*(inter-quartile range) from the boxes.
Points beyond the whiskers are outliers. If the notches of two boxes within the same gray panel do not overlap on the y axis, there is strong
evidence that the true medians differ [69]. Functional pathways that are differentially enriched among the three phases include those that
contribute to the degradation of phthalates on NICU medical devices (bisphenol degradation), protection against oxidative stress (carotenoid
biosynthesis), microbiota driven increases in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) concentrations (lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis), short-chain fatty acids
(fatty acid biosynthesis), isoquinoloine alkaloid biosynthesis, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, glycan biosynthesis and metabolism, membrane

with an asterisk). P values indicate the significance of each association while
beta values indicate the direction and magnitude of the relationship between
weight Z-score and the covariates subjects at their first sample (61.8 vs 32.0%, p = 0.025).
The change in weight Z-score is associated with length
of time in each phase, with the lowest change (at the red
end of the spectrum in Fig. 3a) in subjects (i.e., JE573,
J5028, J1B12) who remain in phase 1 or 2 for prolonged
periods. The largest negative change in weight Z-scores
was associated with delays in transition to a P3 gut
microbiota (p = 0.0023). Delayed achievement of P3 was
also associated with prematurity, with full-term subjects
reaching P3 by 1 month of age much more frequently
than preterm subjects (100 vs 53.4%, p = 0.0001).
Similarly, greater PMA-adjusted growth by discharge
(preterms) or 1 month (full terms) was observed in
the full-term subjects than in the preterm subjects
(mean change in weight Z-score − 0.033 vs − 1.269,
p ≈ 0.0). Eleven infants were treated for necrotizing

followed by more than 2 weeks in P2 (J6B6F, J900B,
J00F9, J2B52, and J8648). One infant who required a
jejunal ostomy remained in P1 for an extended period
of time (J0BE5). Thus, prolonged periods in P1 and P2
may represent the effects of lengthy antibiotic treat-
ment and/or lack of enteral nutrition. Although the
number of cases is insufficient for statistical assess-
ment, our data suggest an association between delayed
transition to P3 and a long-standing feeding intoler-
ance in the NICU that results in administration of
elemental amino acid-based formula (maroon ‘E’
in
the right-hand margin of Fig. 3a).

Early and late periods of the preterm infant microbiome
To demonstrate the utility of modeling the microbiome
as three compositionally defined phases, we compared
gut microbiota development using two constant time pe-
riods based solely on PMA. Specifically, all preterm longi-
tudinal samples (n = 705) were divided into two groups or
periods of equal functional variance based on fitted micro-
biota taxa abundance, an early period (< 34 weeks PMA;
n = 362) and a late period (≥ 34 weeks PMA; n = 343)
(Fig. 1e and Additional file 2: Figure S5). This separ-
ation into early and late periods was used as an un-
biased point of comparison to assess the utility of the
phase-based approach relative to a purely temporal
approach in the context of a nutrition-medication-
microbiota-growth model. Using linear mixed-effects re-
gression models as described for the phase-based nutrition

and 25 full-term infants are plotted against post menstrual age, stratified by subject and sorted by gestational age at birth. Samples for preterm infants
include those collected weekly from birth through discharge. Samples for full-term infants include the first sample after birth (collected at ≤ 20 DOL)
and a second sample, collected ≤ 50 DOL. Microbiota phases (P1, red circle; P2, orange circle; P3, green circle), birth (gray diamond), stool transition
(blue arrowhead), and NEC diagnosis (black square) at discharge are also indicated. Change in weight Z-score from birth to discharge, and elemental
feeding requirements (maroon E) at discharge for preterm infants are indicated in the right margin. The lowest to greatest change in weight Z-score
from birth to discharge spans the spectrum from red to green. In all infants, except for J94F4, the total weight change in weight Z-score from birth to
discharge was negative. Weight Z-score changes in full-term infants were both positive and negative, and negative changes tended to be smaller than
those observed in preterms. b Day of life of stool transition and phase transition for 38 preterm subjects in phase one (P1) at the time of their first
microbiota sample. The relationship between day of life (DOL) for the initial transition out of P1 and from meconium to normal infant stool was
modeled by linear regression. These results demonstrate a highly significant association between the transition out of P1 and from meconium to
normal infant stool that is independent of PMA or prematurity, suggesting that the P1 and meconium microbiota are closely associated an outcome variable, we identified more significant associ-
ations in the phase based model than the period based
model. The complete results of the period-based models
can be found in Additional file 8: Table S7. Overall, our
results demonstrate that the phase-based model of gut
microbiota development in the preterm infant provides a
more robust explanation of the data than the period-based
model.

Potential associations of nutrition and medications with
phase
After identifying the microbiota phase as a significant
factor in infant growth, we sought to identify potential
associations of nutrition and medications with phase by
including them as explanatory variables and microbiota
phases P1 and P2 as the outcome (with P3 as the baseline
phase) in a multivariate mixed-effects logistic regression
model. We completed separate analyses to identify associ-
ations during the early and late periods with nutrition and
medications. Postmenstrual age, nutrient ratios, and the proportion of calories from enteral feeding are signifi-
cantly associated with the phase of the microbiota in both
periods. A higher proportion of nutritional lipids is con-
sistently positively associated with the infant gut micro-
biota being in P2 and negatively associated with P1, while
a higher proportion of proteins is positively associated
with a P1 microbiota at an earlier PMA, negatively associ-
ated with being in P1 at later PMA, and negatively associ-
ated with being in P2 irrespective of PMA. Antibiotics are
positively associated with a P2 gut microbiota, significant
in the later PMA period (p = 0.0015), and nearly
significant in the earlier period (p = 0.0778). The vari-
ables used in these analyses, as well as their p values
and beta estimates, are provided in Table 3A–B and

correspond to phase transition. Emerging evidence sug-
gests that the initial newborn infant gut microbiota is
partially acquired by maternal transmission from the
amniotic fluid and placenta before birth [10–13]. In
utero, the fetus swallows large quantities of amniotic
fluid that is colonized with bacteria in those mothers
who deliver prematurely [11, 33]. Genera in common
between amniotic fluid and the meconium, the earliest
fecal material passed by infants, suggests that pioneer
colonizers of
the infant gut are from this maternal
source. In addition to amniotic fluid that has been con-
sumed, meconium is formed from sloughed off gastro-
intestinal epithelial cells which are generated as debris
during periods of rapid digestive tract development and
convolution of the intestinal epithelial surface. It has
in preterm infants, passage of
been established that
meconium as stool is both delayed and prolonged and is
observed well beyond the first stool, with final clearance
occurring up to several weeks after birth [34].

To identify potential associations between the presence
of meconium and P1 of the microbiota, we examined the
relationship between clearance of the meconium from the
stool and the initial transition of the microbiota out of P1
(Fig. 3b). Two infants remained in P1 (J7F5C and J8560),
but did not survive beyond the first weeks in the NICU.
Two infants cleared their meconium by discharge but
their last microbiota sample was still in P1 (J0BE5 and
J5633). The remaining 38 infants that were observed to be
in P1 at their first rectal sample were included in a linear
regression model using gestational age at birth and the
DOL of their last P1 sample before their initial transition
to another phase as explanatory variables, with the DOL
of meconium clearance as the dependent variable. This
model explained approximately half of the variation in the
day of life of stool transition from meconium to normal
infant stool (R-square = 0.51). Phase transition was found
to be highly significant in this model (p < 0.0001), while
gestational age at birth and the intercept did not exhibit
significant associations (p values = 0.35 and 0.23, respect-
ively), indicating that the time of stool transition was not
associated with prematurity or PMA once microbiota
phase transition was controlled for. On average, the last
P1 sample before the initial phase transition occurred
4.7 days before stool transition was observed (Fig. 3b). To
assess the similarity between the meconium and P1
microbiota samples, we first categorized all 721 samples
as meconium or not, depending on whether the sample
was collected from an infant that had not transitioned to
normal stool, and as P1 or not, according to the decision
tree. A majority of meconium samples were in P1 (59.8%)
and P1 samples in meconium (64.4%) (Additional file 2:
Figure S6A). We next used linear regression analysis to
identify the taxa significantly associated with meconium and then again to identify those associated with P1
(Additional file 2: Figure S6B and Additional file 10:
Table S9). The taxa that differ significantly between
meconium and non-meconium samples are nearly
identical to the taxa that differ significantly between P1
and P2-P3. These results demonstrate a highly significant
association between the transition out of P1 and transition
between meconium and normal infant stool, and that P1
and meconium share similar microbiota.

The gut microbiota of preterm infants at birth is less di-
verse than in full-term infants and at a greater risk for dys-
biosis due to physiological and immune immaturity and
postnatal influences that disrupt developmental succession
of the microbiota as they mature [23, 37, 39, 40]. Factors
that influence microbiota development include prolonged
hospitalization, postnatal medications, and formula feed-
ing [16, 23, 37, 39, 41]. In this study, preterm infants were
fed specialized premature base formulas or breast milk,
which were then fortified with composition and volume Grier et al. Microbiome  (2017) 5:158  Page 11 of 19 guided by daily infant growth rates and clinical evaluation.
All premature infants were supplemented with some li-
quid or powder formula fortification in order to target
their higher macronutrient, phosphorous, and calcium tar-
gets set by current pediatric guidelines. It would be inter-
esting to compare formula supplemented to exclusive
maternal breastmilk intake, though this theoretical control
group’s intake would place infants at unacceptable risk for
growth failure. The composition and volume of formulas
and volume of breast milk was monitored for each infant.
Nutritional intake for each infant was calculated as the ra-
tio of lipid, protein, and carbohydrate, total caloric intake,
and proportion of enteral calories, normalized by body
weight, and received the week prior to fecal sampling for
microbiota analysis. We then evaluated the impact of
these nutrients on successive phases of the microbiota in
relationship to PMA and infant growth. Adjustment of en-
teral and parenteral intake of these nutrients, along with
total calorie intake and medications, were associated with
infant growth.

The succession of gut microbiota in our preterm co-
horts revealed a low level of initial diversity in P1, which
is dominated by facultative anaerobes, followed by in-
creasing diversity and abundance of obligate anaerobes
and a shift to fermentation based metabolism in P3.
Consistent with other studies, we determined that this
programmed, non-random developmental succession of
microbiota is largely determined by PMA [5, 6]. What
drives this patterned succession toward a homeostatic
relationship between the infant and colonizing microbiota
is not known, but likely involves complex interactions be-
tween the mucosal immune system as well as metabolic
interactions within the gut microbial community and the
surrounding tissue and microenvironment, which remain
dynamic during periods of gastrointestinal development in
early life. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) produced by
Paneth cells (PCs) in the epithelium of the small intestine
establish a feedback loop between the host and com-
mensal bacteria that is essential for intestinal homeostasis
and microbiota colonization [39]. Although the number of
immune-competent PCs are significantly higher after
37 weeks of gestation when compared to preterm infants,
the number of immune-competent PCs are higher in in-
fants with GA above 29 weeks compared to infants with
GA under 29 weeks [42]. This period around PMA
29 weeks corresponds to the PMA ~ 30 weeks where we
observed the transition from P2 to P3 in our preterm co-
horts, suggesting that PC AMPs are one factor that modu-
lates the shift toward a community dominated by obligate
anaerobes. Streptococcus and Veillonella in P3, which fre-
quently co-occur and interact metabolically in microbial
communities, through the production of lactic acid by
Streptococcus which is used as a carbon source by Veillo-
nella [43]. Similar metabolic interactions that contribute to succession and homeostasis will
likely be identified
through metabolic profiling of communities within each
phase [6].

Significant associations with phase succession were
identified with exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics,
gut motility agents, corticosteroids for treatment of
bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), histamine-2 recep-
tor (H2)-blockers and proton pump inhibitors (PPI)
that reduce gastric acidity and gastroesophageal reflux
[41, 49, 50]. Previous studies evaluating use of antibi-
otics, H2-blockers and PPI in preterm infants identified
a relationship between their use and development of
necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) [5, 51]. Treatment with
H2-blockers has been shown to favor the proliferation
of Proteobacteria over Firmicutes in fecal microbiota,
which is also associated with development of NEC [41].
Eleven preterm infants with NEC were included in our
study, but were not analyzed as an independent group,
and therefore, we cannot directly associate phase with
changes in microbiota and NEC. However, our analysis
of phase succession demonstrated that treatment of our
preterm infants with H2-blockers or PPI was associated Grier et al. Microbiome  (2017) 5:158  Page 12 of 19 with an increase in Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and
Bacteroidetes in P2 (Additional file 7: Table S6). Expos-
ure to antibiotics in P2-3 and P3 resulted in a decrease
in Firmicutes and increase in Proteobacteria, respectively.
Furthermore, the occurrence of NEC relative to phase
transition suggests an association of NEC with microbiota
reverse transitions from P2 to P1 (subject J0BE5) and P3
to P2 (JF17A and J6B6F) and delayed transition to P3
(J00F9, J900B, and J2B52) (Fig. 3a).

Clinical methods
All study procedures were approved by the University of
Rochester School of Medicine Internal Review Board (IRB)
(Protocol # 37933). Infants included in the study were from
the multicenter Prematurity and Respiratory Outcomes
Program (PROP) and the Respiratory Pathogens Research
Center (RPRC) at the University of Rochester School of
Medicine and were cared for in a single-center Newborn
Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Clinical care in terms of type
and duration of antibiotic treatment, corticosteroids, di-
uretics, motility agents, and H2 receptor agonists as well as
the timing and volume of feeds was at the discretion of
treating physicians. Rectal swabs were used to collect fecal
material from consented infants from 24 PMA until dis-
charge and again at 6 months and 1 year for preterms and
birth and 1 month for full terms. Each sample was collected
by inserting a sterile Copan flocked nylon swab (Copan
Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA) moistened with normal saline
beyond the sphincters into the rectum and then twirled.
Each sample was immediately placed into sterile buffered
saline and stored at 4 °C for no more than 4 h. Samples
were processed daily, which involved extraction of the fecal
material from the swab in a sterile environment and imme-
diately frozen at − 80 °C until DNA extraction. All sampling
swabs, plasticware, buffers, and reagents used for sample
collection and extraction of nucleic acids were sterile and
UV-irradiated to insure no contamination from sources
outside of the infant and sample.

Derived medication and nutrition variables
For all medications considered, binary variables were
derived for each sample that indicate whether or not a
given medication was administered in the week (7 days)
prior to sample collection. Weight Z-score was com-
puted as a proxy for growth. First, weight percentile was
computed as the percentage of weight measures of a
population of the same sex and age that fall below the
observed weight value. We applied Cole’s LMS method
as used by CDC and WHO [54]. The standard growth
chart is based on sex-matched premature infant popula-
tion weight data collected by Fenton and Kim [55, 56].
Weight Z-scores were computed based on the corre-
sponding weight percentiles. Four variables associated
with each sample were derived for nutritional
intake:
total calories per kilogram in the week prior to sample
collection, ratio of lipids or proteins in the week prior to
sample collection, and the ratio of total calories in the
week prior to sample collection that were consumed en-
terally (as opposed to parenterally). These values were
computed based on detailed daily feeding records and
the available nutrition facts for all
formulas, supple-
ments, and total parenteral nutrient preparations used in
the NICU. Total calories per kilogram in the past week is the sum of total calories per kilogram per day for the
7 days prior to sampling. The proportion of enteral calo-
ries computed as the ratio of (grams of lipids/protein
per kilogram) divided by (total calories per kilogram) for
each day, summed over the 7 days prior to sampling.
“Enteral calorie ratio past week” was computed as the
total calories per kilogram consumed enterally in the
week prior to sampling divided by the total calories per
kilogram consumed (enterally and parenterally) in the
same period.

Genomic DNA extraction
Total genomic DNA was extracted with a modified
method using the QIAGEN Fecal DNA kit and FastPrep
mechanical
lysis (MPBio, Solon, OH). 16S ribosomal
RNA (rRNA) was amplified with Phusion High-Fidelity
polymerase (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) and
dual indexed primers specific to the V3-V4 hypervari-
able regions (319F: 5′ ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG
3′; 806R: 3′ ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG 5′) [57].
Amplicons were pooled and paired-end sequenced on
an Illumina MiSeq (Illumina, San Diego, CA) in the
University of Rochester Genomics Research Center.
Each sequencing run included (1) positive controls con-
sisting of a 1:5 mixture of Staphylococcus aureus, Lacto-
coccus lactis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Streptococcus
mutans, and Escherichia coli and (2) negative controls
consisting of sterile saline.

16S rRNA sequence processing
Raw data from the Illumina MiSeq was first converted
into FASTQ format 2 × 300 paired-end sequence files
using the bcl2fastq program, version 1.8.4, provided by
Illumina. Format conversion was performed without de-
multiplexing and the EAMMS algorithm was disabled.
All other settings were default. Sequence processing and
microbial composition analysis were performed with the
Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology (QIIME)
software package [58], version 1.9. Reads were multi-
plexed using a configuration described previously [57].
Briefly, for both reads in a pair, the first 12 bases were a
barcode, which was followed by a primer, then a hetero-
geneity spacer, and then the target 16S rRNA sequence.
Using a custom Python script, the barcodes from each
read pair were removed, concatenated together, and
stored in a separate file. Read pairs were assembled
using fastq-join from the ea.-utils package, requiring at
least 40 bases of overlap and allowing a maximum of
10% mismatched bases. Read pairs that could not be
assembled were discarded. The concatenated barcode
sequences were prepended to the corresponding assem-
bled reads, and the resulting sequences were converted
from FASTQ to FASTA and QUAL files for QIIME ana-
lysis. Barcodes, forward primer, spacer, and reverse primer Grier et al. Microbiome  (2017) 5:158  Page 14 of 19 sequences were removed during de-multiplexing. Reads
containing more than four mismatches to the known
primer sequences or more than three mismatches to all
barcode sequences were excluded from subsequent pro-
cessing and analysis. Assembled reads were truncated at
the beginning of the first 30 base window with a mean
Phred quality score of less than 20 or at the first ambigu-
ous base, whichever came first. Resulting sequences
shorter than 300 bases or containing a homopolymer lon-
ger than six bases were discarded. Operational taxonomic
units (OTU) were picked using the reference-based
USEARCH (version 5.2) [59] pipeline in QIIME, using the
May 2013 release of the GreenGenes 99% OTU database
as a closed reference [60, 61]. An indexed word length
of 128 and otherwise default parameters were used with
USEARCH. Chimera detection was performed de novo
with UCHIME, using default parameters [59]. OTU
clusters with less than four sequences were removed,
and representative sequences used to make taxonomic
assignments for each cluster were selected on the basis
of abundance. The RDP Naïve Bayesian Classifier was
used for taxonomic classification with the GreenGenes
reference database, using a minimum confidence thresh-
old of .85 and otherwise default parameters [62]. Phylo-
genetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of
unobserved states (PICRUSt) [63] was used with the pro-
vided pre-processed KEGG Orthologs database to infer
the putative functional capacities of these communities.

levels six different summarized at 16S rRNA microbiota data pre-processing
To ensure the quality of statistical analysis, microbiome
samples with < 12,000 total reads were excluded from the
subsequent data analyses. Microbiota abundance data
were
(level 2:
PHYLUM–level 7: SPECIES). For characterization of the
microbiota phases and within phase abundance analyses,
raw relative abundance values were used. For beta diver-
sity calculations, normalization by rarefaction at a depth
of 12,000 reads was performed. For longitudinal abun-
dance analyses, at each taxonomic level we excluded OTU
units (taxa) with equal or more than 98% of exactly zero
reads among the 705 samples. In total, 140 genera and
198 species are used for these statistical analyses. The
abundance data were log2 transformed (log2(x + 1)) fol-
lowing normalization by cumulative sum scaling [64].

Comparing taxonomic composition, functional capacity,
and week-to-week dissimilarity between phases
Analysis of variance of taxa abundance at all taxonomic
levels across the three phases of the microbiota was con-
ducted using a Kruskal-Wallis test, and the results are
summarized in Additional file 4: Table S3. Differential
abundance of taxa between each pair of two phases was Grier et al. Microbiome  (2017) 5:158  Page 15 of 19 assessed at each taxonomic level using the metagen-
omicsSeq zero-inflated Gaussian test [64], and the re-
sults are summarized in Additional file 5: Tables S4A–C.
Testing for differential functional capacity between the
phases was performed using LEfSe [67] with per-sample
normalization to 1 M total counts, minimum effect size
of 2.0, alpha of 0.1, an all-against-all strategy, and other-
wise default parameters. The results are summarized in
Additional file 6: Table S5. An exploratory test of the
equality of the median of the week-to-week differences
of samples within individual subjects between the cases
where the phase remains the same and the cases where the
phase changes was performed using the Wilcoxon rank-
sum test. The p value reported for this test is approximate
due to the paired nature of beta-diversity and the presence
of repeated measures from the same subjects.

Determination of early and late time periods
We applied functional principal component analysis to
the microbiota abundance data [21]. The estimated tem-
poral abundance function of taxon v and subject I, xi;v
tð Þ , was represented by a linear combination of eigen-
functions as follows: ^
xi;v tð Þ ¼ ^μ v tð Þ þ cik;vξ k;v tð Þ: X
K v k¼1 Here, ^μ v tð Þ is the estimated mean curve for the vth
taxon, ξk, v(t) is the kth eigen-function for this taxon,
Kv is the number of top eigen-functions needed to explain ≥ 99% of total functional variation, and cik, v
are the linear coefficients. On average,
it takes 2.93
functional principal components to explain ≥ 99% of
total variation at the species level. We calculated the
total functional variance based on the fitted micro-
biota abundance at the species level. More specifically,
we computed the pointwise variance function for each
species from the smoothed temporal curves of abun-
dance at the species level, then took the summation
over all species used in this study V v tð Þ ¼ 1
N−1 X
N i¼1 (cid:2)

M X
M v¼1 V v tð Þ: Here, x⋅;v tð Þ represents the sample mean abundance
function calculated from all subjects. V tð Þ represents the
overall temporal variance at the species level. The max-
imum of V tð Þ occurred at PMA = 34 weeks (rounded to
integers), which is illustrated in Additional file 2: Figure S5.
Based on this cutoff, we define the EARLY period of PMA
to be (0,34) and the LATE period to be [34,∞). The EARLY
interval has 362 data points; the LATE interval has 343
data points.

Association between nutrition/medication and growth
We performed linear mixed-effect regression analysis
similar to the above model on both early and late pe-
riods (Model A) and three phases (Model B) to test
the association between the nutrition/medication factors
(as covariates) and weight Z-score as a proxy for growth
(as the response variables). We included gaBirth (gesta-
tional age at birth) and PMA in the model to control for Grier et al. Microbiome  (2017) 5:158  Page 16 of 19 their possible confounding effects. More specifically,
the following two linear mixed-effects regressions were
performed.

the ith subject measured at the jth time point. βk is the
corresponding linear coefficient (fixed effect); αi
is a
random-effect term that quantifies the within-subject
dependence; and ϵij is the i.i.d. measurement error. In
summary, model A associates weight Z-score to the
time periods (EARLY versus LATE), nutrition and
medication variables, and their interactions. Model B is
much like model A except
it uses microbiota
phases to quantify the developmental stages of micro-
bial community instead. For model A, LATE is consid-
ered as the baseline phase (coded as 0) and EARLY is
coded as 1. For model B, phase 3 is considered as the
baseline phase (coded as 0); phases 1 and 2 are coded
as 1 in two separate binary variables. The interactions
included in both models are defined as the products of
the nutrition/medication variables and period/phase-re-
lated covariates. The significance of associations is de-
test with Satterthwaite’s
termined by regression t
approximation. Due to the use of large number of co-
variates in these models, stepwise model selection
based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC) was
used to reduce model complexity. The results of model
B for weight Z-score are summarized in Table 2 of the
main text. As an example, the linear associations of P2
and percent lipids * P2 with the weight z-score are both
significant (beta = − 0.7766 for P2 and 5.658 for lipids *
P2); meaning that while P2 is correlated with a smaller
weight z-score as compared with the baseline (P3), a
higher percent of lipid intake for P2 subjects increases
the weight Z-scores for subjects in P2. Analyses were
performed in R 3.2.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Com-
puting, Vienna, Austria).
