In order to explore the possible mother-to-infant gut microbiota transmission at sub-OTUs
level, we carried out oligotyping on sequences of Blautia, Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium
since these were the only genera showing a Shannon entropy index sufficient to identify all

GDM offspring gut microbiota composition

Fig 5. Accord-
ingly, these bacteria have been detected in the feces or meconium of full-term newborns in
several studies [24,34,35–37,39,44–48].

A distinct microbial composition was found in our breastfed GDM offspring when compar-
ing them with breastfed neonates from healthy controls, consistent with literature [16,24–25].
In particular, a significantly higher relative abundance of Escherichia and Parabacteroides was
found in our GDM infants. Writing – review & editing: Marianna Pellegrini, Maurizio Cassader, Ezio Ghigo, Luca
