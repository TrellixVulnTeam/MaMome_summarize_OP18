First we explored in detail the in vitro inhibitory effects of a selection of LGC strains against growth and 
pathogenic properties (adhesion to vaginal cells and hyphae formation) of Candida albicans. Subsequently, we evaluated whether L. plantarum 
WCFS1, L. pentosus KCA1 and L. rhamnosus GG formulated in the gel were able to modulate the vaginal micro-
biome over a four-week period in 20 patients suffering from acute VVC (Fig. Of note, when we stratified 
the samples in women who did or did not use RM, the following trend was observed: the women who used RM 
started off with a higher load of fungi and lactobacilli and ended with on average with similar fungal concen-
trations and lower concentrations of lactobacilli as compared to the women who did not use RM (Fig. estimation of LGc and fungal concentrations using qpcR.  To supplement the microbiome data with 
estimations of absolute abundances of lactobacilli and yeast, the DNA samples obtained before were subjected to 
qPCR analysis, as described previously43. Chew, S. Y., Cheah, Y. K., Seow, H. F., Sandai, D. & Than, L. T. L. Probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus reuteri
