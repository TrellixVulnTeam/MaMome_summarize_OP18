suspected (Aagaard et al. Our laboratory and others have shown that
the vaginal microbiota vary in association with

(Jonasson et al. THE VAGINAL MICROBIOME IN
PREGNANCY

With the demonstration that the vaginal micro-
biome ﬂuctuates based on the menstrual cycle,
with intercourse, and (to a much more limited
degree) with clinical symptoms of BV, we and
others sought to characterize the vaginal micro-
biome during pregnancy. Cite this article as Cold Spring Harb Perspect Med 2015;5:a023051
