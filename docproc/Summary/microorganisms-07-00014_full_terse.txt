The majority of these techniques are based on the extraction of DNA and the ampliﬁcation of the 16S
ribosomal RNA gene (rRNA) [5,6]. 16S rRNA sequencing has become the most useful technique to
highlight diversity and abundance of the microbiome. 53] demonstrated that the microbiota of obese children are provided with
an elevated Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio compared to the microbiota of lean children [53].

Furthermore,
Lactobacillus spp. Indeed, patients with CD show a reduction in beneﬁcial
species (Lactobacillus and Biﬁdobacterium) and an increase in those potentially pathogenic (Bacteroides
and E. coli) as compared to healthy subjects [74]. The mucosal layer of CD patients fails to stabilize the
gut microbiota and fails to prevent the host from the invasion of harmful antigens and pathogens [71].
This dysbiosis is reduced, but may still remain, after a gluten-free diet [71,73].

3.1.4. Moreover, none of the differences in alpha
diversity has been observed between PD cases and controls, whereas beta diversity has been
revealed for three bacterial families (Lactobacillaceae, Barnesiellaceae, and Enterococcaceae) [99]. PD is
associated with changes in gut microbiota and this gut microbiota dysbiosis may be the mechanism of
neuroinﬂammation that leads to PD pathology [99].

Hepatic Encephalopathy

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a complication of cirrhosis and is deﬁned as a spectrum
of neuropsychiatric abnormalities in patients with liver dysfunctions. Marcobal, A.; Barboza, M.; Froehlich, J.W.; Block, D.E.; German, J.B.; Lebrilla, C.B.; Mills, D.A. Consumption
