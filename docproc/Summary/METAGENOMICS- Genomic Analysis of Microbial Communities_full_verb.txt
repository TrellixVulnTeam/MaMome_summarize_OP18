from cultured prokaryotes and 54,655 from uncultured prokaryotes, according to
the search terms described by Rapp´e & Giovannoni (90), and many of those from
uncultured organisms afﬁliate with phyla that contain no cultured members. Downloaded from www.annualreviews.orgby Georgetown University on 03/22/13. Exploiting the rich micro-

and has attracted attention because of its abundance and wide distribution on Earth
(63, 85). Other gene sequences include those with homology
to genes encoding cyclic β 1(cid:2)-2(cid:2) glucan synthetase, polyhydroxybutyrate depoly-
merase, Bacteroides fragilis aerotolerance functions, and an operon distantly re-
lated to the lincomycin biosynthesis pathway of Streptomyces lincolnensis (85),
which provide hints about ecological roles of the Acidobacteria. To investigate the phage population in the human gut, Breit-
bart et al. ( 16) described a metagenomic analysis of
marine phage collected at two locations. Small-insert libraries are not useful for capturing complex
pathways requiring many genes, but they provide an appropriate resource for dis-
covery of new metabolic functions encoded by single genes and for reconstructing
metagenomes (114, 115). Although both reconstruction studies reported
sequences from Archaea, which are notoriously difﬁcult to lyse, the Sargasso Sea
study did not report members of the phyla containing only uncultured organisms,
so the effect of the DNA extraction on the diversity of DNA in the metagenomic
libraries method remains unclear. If clones expressing the reporter can be
identiﬁed rapidly by selection for antibiotic resistance or ﬂuorescence-activated
cell sorting, then libraries of sufﬁcient size to represent the diversity of a natu-
ral environment could be screened. Wide distribution and diversity of mem-
