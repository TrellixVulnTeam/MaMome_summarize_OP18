cell-derived  antimicrobial  peptides  can  be  an  important  mediator
of  a  mouse-strain  speciﬁc  microbiota  (Gulati  et  al., As  outlined  above,
speciﬁc  bacterial  functions  such  as  the  expression  of  adhesion  pro-
teins  or  the  induction  of  host-derived  substrates  used  subsequently
for  growth  can  confer  colonization  advantages  (Bry  et  al., /  International  Journal  of  Medical  Microbiology  306  (2016)  316–327

Fig. Relative  sequence  abundance  of  common  phyla  in  the  mouse  gut. In  order  to  avoid  including  analysis  of  unrepresentative  samples,  those  for  which  the  sum  of  abundances  of  common  phyla
was   <80%  or  those  with  <1000  sequences  classiﬁed  as  bacteria  were  discarded,  resulting  in  4797  samples. Hence,  the  rationale  for  using  minimal  microbiota
(i.e.  deﬁned  communities  of  microorganisms  to  mimic   a  complex
ecosystem)  is  not  novel,  but  recent  technical  advances  in  molecular
tools  and  cultivation  approaches  can  enhance  research  in  the  ﬁeld
(Macpherson  and  McCoy,  2015). For  the  establishment  of  another  model  community,  the  simpli-
ﬁed  human  intestinal  microbiota  (SIHUMI),  bacterial  strains  were
selected  based  on  their  reported  presence  in  the  human  intestine
and  their  in  vitro  fermentation  capabilities  (Becker  et  al., As  discussed  above,  gnotobiotic  models  col-
onized  by  human  gut  bacteria  are  suitable  for  testing  clinical
relevance,  but  they  may   be  problematic  for  establishment  of  mouse
models  with  deﬁned  microbiota  in  terms  of  colonization  efﬁcacy
and  regulation  of  host  physiology  (Chung  et  al., Dominant  bacteria  in
the  gut,  including  important  families  such  as  the  Lachnospiraceae
and  Ruminococcaceae,   must  rapidly  be  re-classiﬁed  to  avoid  mis-
interpretations  of  data  (Lawson  and  Rainey,  2015). Moreover,  all
strains  should  be  made  available  to  the  entire  scientiﬁc  community
to  avoid  losing  them  over  the  years. Atarashi,  K.,  Tanoue,  T.,  Oshima,  K.,  Suda,  W.,   Nagano,  Y.,  Nishikawa,  H.,  Fukuda,  S.,
