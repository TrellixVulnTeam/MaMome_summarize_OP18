Vieira et al. 2014), the purpose
of this mini-review is to highlight the importance of alterations
in the oral and gut microbiota during estrogen deﬁciency and
determine their relevance in oral infections and inﬂammatory
diseases that are associated with menopause. Therefore, given that many menopausal women also suﬀer from
oral discomforts in addition to climacteric symptoms (Meurman
et al., Some of the
main complaints from women in menopause include dry mouth
and tooth loss, and the existing data have focused on the salivary
microbial composition and the microbiota characteristics of the
gingival sulcus. Because the salivary composition may be inﬂuenced by the
presence of oral diseases, prescribed medications and general
health (Belstrom et al., Periodontal Support
The periodontium is the specialized tissue that both surrounds
and supports the teeth. In addition,
changes in periodontal status were found to be associated
with variations in sex hormone levels (Mascarenhas et al., THE INTERACTION BETWEEN GUT
MICROBIOTA AND FEMALE SEX
HORMONES

As mentioned earlier, female sex hormones levels inﬂuence
the composition of the microbiota in many sites of the body,
especially the gut. Experimental ﬁndings in mice have shown
that
female sexual
hormones, and immunity are associated with the development
of autoimmune diseases (Yurkovetskiy et al., Microbiota and Female Sex Hormones

levels or the absence of estrogen hormone in the metabolism of
women have not been suﬃciently studied and require further
clariﬁcation. Experimental studies have also demonstrated
similar results. However, another study compared 48
postmenopausal breast cancer patients and 48 control patients
and observed that postmenopausal women with breast cancer
exhibited an altered composition and estrogen-independent
low diversity of their microbiota (Goedert et al., The oral and
gut microbiota have been shown to inﬂuence many diseases, such as
osteoporosis, weight gain and lipid deposition, breast cancer and
periodontitis. Indeed,
the administration of soy isoﬂavones to postmenopausal women
was shown to increase the concentration of Biﬁdobacterium and
suppress Clostridiaceae, which are known to be involved in
inﬂammatory diseases (Frankenfeld et al., The use of hormone
replacement
indicated for all menopausal women,
and considering that probiotics and prebiotics can aﬀect the
dysfunction of bone, adipose tissue, oral and other tissues,
such treatments may constitute an important
therapeutic
strategy. REFERENCES
