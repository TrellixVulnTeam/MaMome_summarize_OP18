good evidence on gut health and these findings should be 
communicated to health care professionals and consumers. It is planned that the subjects will prospectively 
followed up every 5 years. Taken together, the population-based LifeLines cohort 
is providing valuable insight into the complex interaction 
of microbiome with human health and will be instrumen-
tal in outlining new biomarkers and treatments for human 
diseases. Fiber-degrading bacteria include Ruminococcus 
callidus, Ruminococcus albus, Blautia obeum and Prevo-
tella spp. Caco-2 cells promoted the growth and metabolism of 
the anaerobic F. prausnitzii, while genes involved in inflam-
mation and oxidative stress in Caco-2 cells were suppressed 
by F. prausnitzii [80].

As previously mentioned, dysbiosis in infancy is asso-
ciated with an increased risk for immunological diseases 
such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, type 1 diabetes and celiac 
disease in addition to metabolic diseases, e.g. obesity and 
type 2 diabetes [84, 85].

Pregnancy is shown to alter the maternal gut micro-
biota. It is known since long that birth 
mode, feeding mode and antibiotic exposure, all affect the 
development of the neonatal microbiome. It has become clear that the fetus and placenta are not 
sterile and the transfer of bacteria occurs from mother to the 
fetus during pregnancy. Central control of the gut is mediated through the HPA 
axis and the autonomic nervous system. lactis, 
Streptococcus thermophiles, and two Lactobacillus spp. How-
ever, the underlying mechanisms of these interactions are 
largely unclear and, at the present time, it is not possible to 
differentiate between the microbes involved. Author contributions  MHM wrote this manuscript. RJMB, RAR,
