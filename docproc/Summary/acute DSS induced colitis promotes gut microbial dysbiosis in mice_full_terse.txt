Even though they have limitations
like all other models, they present some important
immunological and histopathological aspects of IBD in
humans [16]. The most widely used and characterized
experimental model of erosion and inﬂammation related
to UC in mice is the dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-
induced colitis, which is developed by DSS administration
either in the drinking water [16, 17] or via intragastric
catheter [18, 19]. The DSS induces a reproducible
acute colitis [16]; however, there is some controversy
regarding the type of inﬂammation that is induced. (cid:1) 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA,Weinheim

J. Basic Microbiol. Generally,
despite these differences in relative abundances of
speciﬁc phylotypes, there appear to be a consensus in
overall decrease in biodiversity in IBD patients and in
murine models of colitis [33, 35, 68, 75].

The mechanisms by which DSS induced stronger
bacterial shifts in the feces than in the colon mucosa

are not fully understood. Given that the microbial analysis of diversity, commu-
nity composition and also changes at phylum level for
colonic samples did not show any signiﬁcant difference
between the DSS and control mice, the results suggest
that analysis at microbial functional level might reveal
important colitis-related changes in gut microbiome
that are otherwise not noticeable at higher phylogenetic
or community levels. Longitudinal analysis of inﬂammation and micro-
biota dynamics in a model of mild chronic dextran sulfate
sodium-induced colitis in mice. 2016, 56, 1–13
