and anti-inflammatory responses, and balances in the community structure of gut bacteria
may be intimately linked to the proper function of the immune system. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 July 14. Moreover, depletion of the CD4+CD25+ T-cell subset
abolished the ability of the probiotic-treated DCs to protect from disease, suggesting that L.
rhamnosus-treated DCs can initiate TReg-cell activity79. These data have identified a single molecule made by a
symbiotic microorganism that stimulates CD4+ T cells to make IL-10, required for the
suppression of the inflammatory process during colitis, and suggest that other beneficial
bacteria may produce factors that can positively shape the host immune response during
IBD. NIH-PA Author Manuscript

other words, if symbiosis factors actively maintain health, can dysbiosis reduce bacterial-
mediated immune regulation that subsequently leads to inflammation? PubMed: 17132046] [Using
B.thetaiotaomicron (a symbiont) co-colonization with Bifidobacterium longum,(a probiotic) in
germfree mice, this study demonstrates that B.longum can increase the diversity of polysaccarides
that can be degraded by B.thetaiotaomicron, Thus, demonstrating another layer of complexity in
host microbial interactions; that intestinal bacterial species can impact the function of one
another.]
