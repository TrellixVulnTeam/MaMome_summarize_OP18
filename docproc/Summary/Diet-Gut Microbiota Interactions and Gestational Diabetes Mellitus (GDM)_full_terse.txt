The crucial role of the intestinal microbiota in modulating insulin resistance and the inﬂammatory
response in GDM pregnancies has been reported by a few studies [13,14]. It is well known that diet is
able to modulate the microbiota composition rapidly, within a few days [15,16]. Emerging evidence
has shown a differential role of speciﬁc nutrients on metabolic outcomes, based on the individual
microbial pattern. Some of the changes in the bacterial species related to GDM have been reported also in
T2DM patients, such as the reduction in Roseburia and Akkermansia muciniphila, and the increase in
Proteobacteria [21].

Functional analyses showed a greater abundance of membrane transport and energy metabolism
pathways, lipopolysaccharide and phosphotransferase systems, and lower amino acid metabolic
pathways in the microbiome of GDM patients [38].

If the changes in the gut microbiota contribute to or are a consequence of the development of
GDM is a debated question. Koren, O.; Goodrich, J.K.; Cullender, T.C.; Spor, A.; Laitinen, K.; Bäckhed, H.K.; Gonzalez, A.; Werner, J.J.;
