Data processing is considered to be the step necessary for
converting the raw data, such as metagenomics sequence reads,
into biologically meaningful representations, such as OTU counts
using bioinformatics tools, some of which are done in the
sequencing device itself. For
example, SparCC is used for analyzing the TwinUK dataset to
identify bacterial taxa whose abundances are inﬂuenced by host
genetics (Goodrich et al., In a diﬀerent
study, the classiﬁcation task was to identify healthy vs. unhealthy
donors given relative OTU abundance data (including species
level) coming from shotgun metagenomics sequencing of the gut
(as well as other body sites) (Pasolli et al., doi: 10.3390/nu7010017
