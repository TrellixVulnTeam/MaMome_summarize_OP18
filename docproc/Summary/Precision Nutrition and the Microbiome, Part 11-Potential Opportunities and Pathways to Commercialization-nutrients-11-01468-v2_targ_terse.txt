Interventions involving probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics and dietary ﬁbre also oﬀer opportunities
to “fertilize” our microbiota. For example,
consumption of the probiotics Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Biﬁdobacterium lactis BB12 from T1
of pregnancy in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study signiﬁcantly reduced the incidence of GDM
(P = 0.003)  However, probiotic supplementation for four weeks (weeks 24 to 28 of gestation)
in obese pregnant women did not inﬂuence maternal metabolic proﬁle, fasting blood glucose, or
pregnancy outcomes  It is possible that the short-term probiotic consumption in this study did not
permit the probiotic to induce beneﬁcial changes to the gut microbiota and hence host metabolism. lactis plus
the prebiotic inulin compared to a rate of 12% in the prebiotic group and 18% in the control group 
The prebiotic FOS in combination with a probiotic mixture consisting of L. acidophilus, Biﬁdobacterium
longum, Biﬁdobacterium biﬁdum, and Streptococcus thermophilus signiﬁcantly reduced the incidence of
NEC in preterm infants fed breast milk compared to the control group who
received breast milk alone  In the same study the incidences of Stage
II and Stage III (severe) NEC were nil in the test group compared to 5 and 2 cases in the control. Chronic fatigue syndrome is characterised by persistent and relapsing tiredness and 97% of
patients report neurological disturbances resulting in a variety of emotional symptoms of which
anxiety and depression are the most common  In a pilot study involving 39 chronic fatigue
syndrome patients intake of L. casei strain Shirota for two months resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in
anxiety symptoms compared with the control group (P = 0.01)  Lactobacillus and biﬁdobacteria
counts were also signiﬁcantly increased as a result of probiotic administration. Consumption of inulin-type fructans by obese women at 16 g/day for 3 months led to gut
microbiota changes which included an increase in Biﬁdobacterium and F. prausnitzii, both of which
negatively correlated with serum lipopolysaccharides The prebiotic also decreased Bacteroides
intestinalis, Bac. Furthermore, the presence of high levels of Clostridium sphenoides,
a common gut inhabitant and Firmicutes member, in the faecal microbiota of obese individuals before
dietary invention was associated with a decrease in cholesterol following intervention while obese
individuals with abnormally low abundance of this species did not beneﬁt in terms of cholesterol
levels.
