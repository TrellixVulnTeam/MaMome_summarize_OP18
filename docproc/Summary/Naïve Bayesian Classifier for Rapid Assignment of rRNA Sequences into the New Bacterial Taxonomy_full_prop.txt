No. Aligned 16S rRNA sequences were selected at the RDP
website and analyzed using the RDP Tree Builder tool. This tool utilizes Weigh-
bor (5), which uses the weighted neighbor-joining algorithm of phylogenetic
reconstruction. Tree Builder incorporates branch-order conﬁdence estimation using 100 boot-
strap samples. The resultant tree was downloaded in PostScript format and
embellished with Adobe Illustrator. Each line in the hierarchy
contains summary information, including the taxon rank and name and the
number of query sequences assigned to that taxon. Clicking on the “show assignment
detail” link will display the detailed classiﬁcation results for all or a speciﬁed
subset of the user’s queries. The online version of Library Compare is available at http://rdp.cme.msu.edu
/comparison. A user can upload two ﬁles containing sequences from two librar-
ies. These sequences formed the Bergey corpus. All available
(23,095) near-full-length ((cid:1)1,200 bases) 16S rRNA sequences were obtained
from the January 2004 release of the RDP. A similar word-based clas-
siﬁcation scheme has been used to search for horizontal gene transfer events in
whole-genome sequences (21). By Bayes’ theorem, the probability that an un-
known query sequence, S, is a member of genus G is P(G¦S) (cid:2) P(S¦G) (cid:5)
P(G)/P(S), where P(G) is the prior probability of a sequence being a member of
G and P(S) the overall probability of observing sequence S (from any genus). For each query sequence, the collection of
all eight-character subsequences (words) in the query was ﬁrst calculated. So for each bootstrap trial, a subset of one-eighth of the words was
randomly chosen (with replacement) and the words in this subset were then used
to calculate the joint probability. 73, 2007

a Frequency of most common assignments out of 100 bootstrap samplings. For these se-
quences, the (obviously) incorrect genus assignment was not
considered in the summary statistics, but the results were in-
cluded for higher ranks containing other genera with valid
training sets (Fig. Bergey’s taxonomic placement of
these three sequences appeared not to be congruent with the
derived phylogeny (Fig. For these high-throughput experiments,
the RDP Classiﬁer can provide rapid taxonomic placement and
summary data, including the number of input sequences be-
longing to each taxon. The majority of available rRNA
sequences are short (under 1,200 bases in length), and short
partial sequences are commonly used for environmental survey
sequencing. The RDP Clas-
siﬁer misclassiﬁed three sequences from the Alicyclobacil-
laceae: Sulfobacillus disulﬁdooxidans and Sulfobacillus thermo-
sulﬁdooxidans, which were both misclassiﬁed in the genus
Alicyclobacillus, and Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris, which was
misclassiﬁed in the genus Bacillus. Unlike the Seq-
Match nearest-neighbor classiﬁer, the RDP naı¨ve Bayesian
Classiﬁer uses information averaged over the entire genus and
hence is less inﬂuenced by individual misplaced training se-
quences. In release 5, sequence Z21979 was
listed as coming from the type strain (VKM 1269) of S. thermosulﬁ-
dooxidans. In our analysis, however, the sequence for
K1 given in the naming paper (accession number AF137502) is 8%
different from that for Z21979. Sequence X60602 was published
in 1991 as from the type strain (DSM 3922) for A. acidoterrestris (1). We chose to use SeqMatch for the comparison, because it, like
the RDP Classiﬁer, is offered through the RDP. For exam-
ple, in one library of Acidobacteria environmental clone se-
quences, 72 of 77 sequences were classiﬁed with less than 80%
conﬁdence even at the phylum level (not shown). During that
time, the RDP has updated the Classiﬁer to use data from
three successive versions of Bergey’s taxonomic outline. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
