more similar to MOM despite the diﬀerences between MOM and DHM [81]. Preterm infants are
prone to develop free radical-associated conditions [82] that may be inﬂuenced by the microbiota. In contrast, Paenibacillus predominated in term placental specimens [15].
Other authors have proposed that the fetal intestinal microbiota derives from swallowed amniotic ﬂuid,
and that they may trigger an inﬂammatory response which leads to premature birth [91]. Considering
that some Lactobacillus strains may possess potential anti-inﬂammatory activities, and could regulate
blood glucose levels in diabetic humans [93], the low abundance of Lactobacillus in placentas of low
birth weight neonates reported by Zheng et al. [ Bousquet, J.; Khaltaev, N.; Cruz, A.A.; Denburg, J.; Fokkens, W.J.; Togias, A.; Burnham, C.A.; Weinstock, E.S.;
