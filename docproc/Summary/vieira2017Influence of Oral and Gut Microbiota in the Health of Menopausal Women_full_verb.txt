Vieira et al. 2007), such as cardiovascular diseases (Joshipura et al., Periodontitis is a chronic inﬂammatory process that occurs
in response to an increase in Gram-negative bacteria in the
bioﬁlm (Ruby and Barbeau, 2002), aﬀecting the tissues that
surround and support the teeth. In a cohort study that included 106 women aged 50–58 years,
hormone replacement therapy led to a decreased number of
positive samples showing the periodontal pathogens P. gingivalis,
Prevotella intermedia, and T.
forsythia from the subgingival
plaque (Tarkkila et al., In mice, estrogen seems to modulate IL-1 production
and participate in the resistance of females to disseminating
dentoalveolar infections, leading to the enhanced localization
of these infections (Youssef and Stashenko, 2017), which draws
attention to the potential role of sex-related hormones in the
modulation of oral mucosal infections. Experimental ﬁndings in mice have shown
that
female sexual
hormones, and immunity are associated with the development
of autoimmune diseases (Yurkovetskiy et al., Experimental studies have also demonstrated
similar results. We must mention that the gut microbiota may inﬂuence
the risk for breast cancer through eﬀects on endogenous
estrogens produced by adipose tissue in postmenopausal women
