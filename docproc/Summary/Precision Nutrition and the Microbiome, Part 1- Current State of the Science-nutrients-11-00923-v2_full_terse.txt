This vast array of data has contributed
to a deeper understanding of the role of the gut microbiome in health and disease, the factors which
shape it, and the potential to harness its therapeutic potential for optimal health. Compositional and functional diﬀerences have
been observed in the gut microbiota of type 2 diabetes individuals which included a moderate degree
of microbial dysbiosis, reduction in the abundance of some universal butyrate-producing bacteria, an
increase in opportunistic pathogens, and an increase in microbial functions conferring oxidative stress
resistance [235,236]. In apparently healthy participants, Kashtanova et al. [ Principal component
analysis revealed distinct microbiota on days 7 and 14, whereby the soy protein group was separate
from the meat and casein groups [347]. In another similar study, soy protein was associated with
increased faecal SCFAs in rats compared to rats fed white meat, red meat or casein [348]. The soy group
also had a higher relative abundance of Bacteroides and Prevotella which are the major propionate and
other SCFA producers [349]. Lactobacillus, a genus known for its beneﬁcial eﬀects was increased in the
gut microbiota by ingestion of meat proteins. El Kaoutari, A.; Armougom, F.; Gordon, J.I.; Raoult, D.; Henrissat, B. The abundance and variety of
