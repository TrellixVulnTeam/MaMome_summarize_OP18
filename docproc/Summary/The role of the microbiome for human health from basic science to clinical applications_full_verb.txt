Crohn’s disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC); and irritable 
bowel syndrome (IBS). In many cases the 
suggested mechanisms are 
speculative at the present time. For some products there is already 
good evidence on gut health and these findings should be 
communicated to health care professionals and consumers. The Microbiome working group within the UMCG has 
embarked recently on a large project within the LifeLines 
cohort: the 10K metagenome project. It is planned that the subjects will prospectively 
followed up every 5 years. Fiber-degrading bacteria include Ruminococcus 
callidus, Ruminococcus albus, Blautia obeum and Prevo-
tella spp. Caco-2 cells promoted the growth and metabolism of 
the anaerobic F. prausnitzii, while genes involved in inflam-
mation and oxidative stress in Caco-2 cells were suppressed 
by F. prausnitzii [80].

Anti-oxidants  including  riboflavin  and  vitamin  C  are 
being investigated as new targets for intervention for the 
treatment of dysbiosis. Transfer of bacteria from the mother to the 
fetus has also been shown, indicating that pregnancy may be impor-
tant for colonization of the fetal/infant gut

As previously mentioned, dysbiosis in infancy is asso-
ciated with an increased risk for immunological diseases 
such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, type 1 diabetes and celiac 
disease in addition to metabolic diseases, e.g. obesity and 
type 2 diabetes [84, 85].
