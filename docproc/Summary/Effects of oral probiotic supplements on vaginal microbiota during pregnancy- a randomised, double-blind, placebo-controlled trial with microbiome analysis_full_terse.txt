and have been reported to colonise the vagina in some
non-pregnant women within 2 weeks of treatment.19 Before
the start of the study, we conﬁrmed the viability of the lac-

techniques would detect them in culture. BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of
