given  ecosystem. Speciﬁcally,  B.  theta  can  modify  host  epithelial  differen-
tiation  in  a  way  that  supports  its  own   growth:  it  promotes  the
production  of  fucosylated  glycans  by  the  host  and  in  turn  uses
them  as  nutrient  sources  (Bry  et  al., B.  theta  was   shown  to  adapt  to  the  presence  of  Eubac-
terium  rectale  or  the  probiotic  strains  Biﬁdobacterium  longum  and
Lactobacillus  casei  by  expanding  the  breadth  of  its  carbohydrate
utilization  (Mahowald  et  al., Clostridium

the  composite  “xenomicrobiota”  established  in  recipient  hosts
were  eventually  out-competed  by  an  autochthonous  murine  gut
microbiota,  indicating  that  the  murine  gut  is  a  highly  selective
environment  for  bacterial  colonization. Also,  the  host  immune  system  can  shape  the
microbiota  and  speciﬁc  bacteria  can  shape  the  immune  system,
resulting  in  a  complex  cross-talk  equilibrium  (Atarashi  et  al., /  International  Journal  of  Medical  Microbiology  306  (2016)  316–327

6034   mouse  gut  samples  available  in  the  Sequence  Read  Archive. The  term  common
phyla   refers  to  those  found  in  >10%  of  all  samples. For  the  establishment  of  another  model  community,  the  simpli-
ﬁed  human  intestinal  microbiota  (SIHUMI),  bacterial  strains  were
selected  based  on  their  reported  presence  in  the  human  intestine
and  their  in  vitro  fermentation  capabilities  (Becker  et  al., As  discussed  above,  gnotobiotic  models  col-
onized  by  human  gut  bacteria  are  suitable  for  testing  clinical
relevance,  but  they  may   be  problematic  for  establishment  of  mouse
models  with  deﬁned  microbiota  in  terms  of  colonization  efﬁcacy
and  regulation  of  host  physiology  (Chung  et  al., In  order  to  provide  an  overview  of  the  diversity  of  common
and  dominant  bacterial  taxa  in  the  mouse  intestine  from  cur-
rently  available  datasets,  we  followed  the  same  universal  16S  rRNA
amplicon  approach  as  described  in  Fig. More  cultivation-based  projects  are  urgently  needed  to  isolate
novel  bacteria  from  the  mouse  gut,  as  done  for  other  ecosystems
(Bai  et  al., Dominant  bacteria  in
the  gut,  including  important  families  such  as  the  Lachnospiraceae
and  Ruminococcaceae,   must  rapidly  be  re-classiﬁed  to  avoid  mis-
interpretations  of  data  (Lawson  and  Rainey,  2015). Taxonomic  tree  of  common  bacterial  families  in  the  mouse  gut. A  high  resolution  view  of
the  mouse  gut  microbiome  combined  with  well-curated  strains
and  genomes  collections  will  offer  unprecedented  opportunities
towards  the  establishment  of  standardized  mouse  models  and
towards  the  study  of  speciﬁc  bacterial  functions  based  on  the  asso-
ciation  of  mice  colonized  by  a  model  microbiota  with  one  strain
carrying  the  given  function,  which  is  less  artiﬁcial  than  mono-
colonization  of  germ-free  mice. How  should  a  deﬁned  microbial  community  in  gnotobiotic
mice  be  composed  to  serve  as  a  useful  model  for  investigat-
ing  the  principles  underlying  host–microbiota  interactions? This
certainly  depends  on  the  question  to  be  investigated. Atarashi,  K.,  Tanoue,  T.,  Oshima,  K.,  Suda,  W.,   Nagano,  Y.,  Nishikawa,  H.,  Fukuda,  S.,
