lationship  between  carbs  and  glycemic  response. The relationship between iAUC and BMI / waist-to-hip ratio 
(Figure 3E second and third panels) is the opposite of that previously 
reported  in  studies  such  as  [Zeevi  2015].  We  hypothesize  that  this 
may  reflect  the  self-reported  good  health  and  high  exercise  rate 
within this study population. yclnex.2016.01.001
