Lactobacillus crispatus  CTV-05  (Lactin-V,  Osel) 
is  a  live  biotherapeutic  product  that  contains  a 
naturally occurring vaginal strain of L. crispatus. Premenopausal women 18 to 45 years of age 
were screened for eligibility after providing writ-
ten  informed  consent  to  be  screened. Potentially eligible wom-
en completed a standard 5-day course of vaginal 
0.75% metronidazole within 30 days before the 
screening visit. Copyright © 2020 Massachusetts Medical Society. The  ran-
domization sequence was prepared by statisti-
cians at Emmes. The primary safety outcome was the percent-
age of participants who had at least one adverse 
event by week 24 that was considered to be re-
lated to Lactin-V or placebo. Pearson’s  chi-
square test was used to test the null hypothesis 
that the cumulative percentages of participants 
who  had  recurrence  of  bacterial  vaginosis  by 
weeks 12 and 24 in the Lactin-V group would be 
equal to those in the placebo group, with a two-
sided  alternative  hypothesis. Post 
hoc  sensitivity  analyses  for  missing  data  were 
performed  to  calculate  risk  ratios  and  corre-
sponding  confidence  intervals;  the  hypothesis 
tests  were  performed  with  the  use  of  logistic-

regression  multiple  imputation,  under  the  as-
sumption  of  a  monotone  pattern  of  missing 
data.23,24 The results of the prespecified inten-
tion-to-treat  analyses  in  which  missing  data 
were  imputed  with  the  use  of  the  last-observa-
tion-carried-forward  method  were  included  in 
the final clinical trial report and were reported 
to ClinicalTrials.gov. More than half the participants reported a his-

24  weeks  of  follow-up. Among  women  with  a  history  of  bacterial 
vaginosis,  the  use  of  Lactin-V  after  treatment 
with vaginal metronidazole resulted in a lower 
incidence of recurrence of bacterial vaginosis at 
12 weeks than placebo. A data sharing statement provided by the authors is available
