environmental exposures (Brown et al., The gut microbiome provides a broad range of functions. 2016; Kim, Romero, 
Chaemsaithong, & Kim, 2015). Gut microbes found in amniotic fluid of women who 
experienced preterm premature rupture of membranes suggest that the gut microbiome could 
play a role in intrauterine infections (DiGiulio et al., Author manuscript; available in PMC 2018 November 01. Author Manuscript

The gut microbiome is also shaped by diet and genetics. Conversely, certain 
dietary nutrients, namely low-fat protein (for instance beans, skinless chicken, lean beef), 
organic proteins and produce (which reduces exposure to dietary antibiotics and pesticides), 
unsaturated fatty acids (for instance in canola and olive oils, flaxseeds, and salmon), whole 
grains, and certain strains of probiotics have been found to promote a healthy gut 
microbiome, enhance intestinal integrity and reduce excessive systemic inflammation 
(Griffin, 2015; Kashtanova et al., SCFA production by the gut microbiota is negatively correlated 
with body mass index (Gomez-Arango et al., Increased maternal serum SCFA levels 
can positively influence metabolic changes seen in pregnancy: maternal weight gain, glucose 
metabolism and levels of various metabolic hormones (Koren et al., In a healthy 

MCN Am J Matern Child Nurs. Disproportionate rates of infections have been found in chronically 
stressed minority populations and are thought to be a source of higher rates of preterm birth 
in these populations through dysbiotic gut microbe translocation mechanisms previously 
described (Culhane, Rauh, & Goldenberg, 2006; Mendez, Hogan, & Culhane, 2014). Negative 
interference with the brain-gut axis (depicted on right side of Figure 1) during these times is 
associated with a higher maternal and child risk for chronic intestinal disorders, conditions 
which affect weight and growth, and even neuropsychiatric disorders (Mayer, Knight, et al., Health care recommendations that promote the IOM guidelines for maternal weight 
gain by prepregnant BMI category, high quality diet and gut eubiosis should be considered 
in the delivery of prenatal care and in client education. Appropriate 
type, duration and indication of prebiotic, probiotic and antibiotic use in the prevention and 
treatment of illness will become an important topic for discussion with clients in the future, 
since all act on the gut microbiome and may impact overall health and gestational weight 
gain (Griffin, 2015). In a recent clinical trial, supplementation with specific strains of probiotics, such as 
Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Lactobacillus acidophilus, combined with dietary 
counseling have been found to improve glucose metabolism in healthy pregnant and 
lactating women (Brantsaeter et al., Acknowledgments
