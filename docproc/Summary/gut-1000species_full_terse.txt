order Actinobacteriales are human-associated bacteria that
are subabundant and only scarcely detected in the gastro-
intestinal tract. have been recognized as gastrointestinal
inhabitants, although a number of other species that are
ofﬁcially classiﬁed within different genera (predominantly
Clostridium) belong to the Peptostreptococcaceae family
according to their SSU rRNA gene sequence (Fig. Not much is known about the role of this
group of strictly anaerobic bacteria in the human gastro-
intestinal tract, but it is noteworthy that bacteria that
belong to the Christensenella/Catabacter group were
reported to be dramatically (20-fold) depleted in fecal
samples of ulcerative patients relative to controls (Rajili(cid:1)c-
