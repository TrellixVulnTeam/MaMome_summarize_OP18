levels of taxonomy, with intriguing thoughts about the
of
interplay and use of molecular function descriptors vs. taxonomic
descriptors, the reader is referred to Knights et al. ( The result is a set of informative features, perhaps including
original OTUs along with higher-level aggregations of taxonomic
features, that can be utilized for downstream machine learning
(Oudah and Henschel, 2018). Standard feature selection
algorithms, Fizzy and MetAML, which do not capitalize on the
hierarchical structure of features, were also tested by Oudah
and Henschel (2018) using several machine learning methods
on real datasets. Frontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org
