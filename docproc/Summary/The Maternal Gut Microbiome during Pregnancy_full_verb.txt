MCN Am J Matern Child Nurs. Metabolic Changes in Pregnancy and the Gut Microbiome

The consequences of gut dysbiosis that lead to obesity and, likely, to excessive gestational 
weight gain, have only recently been explored in human pregnancy (Angelakis, Merhej, & 
Raoult, 2013). Yet, as the pregnancy advances, the abundance of gut bacteria associated with 
inflammatory states increases in nearly 70% of women (Santacruz et al., Clinical Implications of the Gut Microbiome in Pregnancy

The gut microbiome and the brain-gut axis are key players in the critical prenatal period 
when the maternal and fetal microbiome are particularly sensitive and changes can impact 
fetal brain development (Borre et al., Negative 
interference with the brain-gut axis (depicted on right side of Figure 1) during these times is 
associated with a higher maternal and child risk for chronic intestinal disorders, conditions 
which affect weight and growth, and even neuropsychiatric disorders (Mayer, Knight, et al., In a recent clinical trial, supplementation with specific strains of probiotics, such as 
Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Lactobacillus acidophilus, combined with dietary 
counseling have been found to improve glucose metabolism in healthy pregnant and 
lactating women (Brantsaeter et al., Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology. Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences. Retrieved from http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/

Conducting a detailed client dietary assessment, individualized education and 
counseling to follow a diet with 70–90 grams low fat, organic protein daily, 
unsaturated fatty acids, whole grains, high fiber, low processed sugars that 
includes daily probiotic dairy or other cultured food products (especially 
containing L. acidophilus, B. lactis, and L. rhamnosus). Author Manuscript
