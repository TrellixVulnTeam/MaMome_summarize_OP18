Introduction

Over the past decade, the essential role that the gut micro-
biota plays in the developmental programming of the neo-
nate, including growth trajectories, metabolism, and immune 
and cognitive development, has been demonstrated [1–3]. 
Thus, fostering the development of the microbiome in the 
first 1000 days of life is critical to supporting lifelong health. Additionally, rural chil-
dren had significantly higher fecal butyrate and propionate 
concentrations, suggesting that the fiber-rich diet in the rural 
children promotes a microbiota composition with greater 
fermentative capacity [33].

Greater Bifidobacterium abundance in 1- to 4-year-olds 
compared to adults has been reported [28], and recent stud-
ies have shown that the relative abundance of Bifidobac-
terium in older children is related to dietary intake and is
