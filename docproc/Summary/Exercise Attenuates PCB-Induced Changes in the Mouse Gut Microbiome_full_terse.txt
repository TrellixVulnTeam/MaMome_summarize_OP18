were  housed  individually  in  plastic  cages 
equipped with a running wheel (Coulbourn 
Instruments,  Whitehall,  PA);  however, 
wheels  were  locked  in  cages  of  seden­
tary mice. In contrast, the abundance 
of  bacterial  species  was  elevated  by  2.9% 
(Student’s t­test, p < 0.05) in PCB­treated 
exercised  mice  as  compared  PCB­treated 
sedentary  mice,  providing  additional  evi­
dence that exercise can protect against PCB­
mediated alterations in the gut microbiota. In addi­
tion, alterations of the gut microbiome can 
affect PCB­induced disruption of the intestinal 
barrier and translocation of lipopoly saccharides 
into the blood stream (Choi JJ et al. Holmes E, Li JV, Athanasiou T, Ashrafian H, Nicholson JK. BMC  Bioinformatics  7:371;
