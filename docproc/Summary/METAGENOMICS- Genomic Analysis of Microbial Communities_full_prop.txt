from cultured prokaryotes and 54,655 from uncultured prokaryotes, according to
the search terms described by Rapp´e & Giovannoni (90), and many of those from
uncultured organisms afﬁliate with phyla that contain no cultured members. Downloaded from www.annualreviews.orgby Georgetown University on 03/22/13. Other than 16S rRNA gene sequences,
little is known about the bacteria within the 22 poorly cultured phyla and 26 candi-
date phyla. In this review, we refer to them as uncultured. Soil

Annu. Alternatively, sequences that
carry conserved regions of genes associated with antibiotic biosynthesis, such as
the polyketide synthases and peptide synthetases, may be identiﬁed by sequenced-
based screens that do not require heterologous gene expression. Other gene sequences include those with homology
to genes encoding cyclic β 1(cid:2)-2(cid:2) glucan synthetase, polyhydroxybutyrate depoly-
merase, Bacteroides fragilis aerotolerance functions, and an operon distantly re-
lated to the lincomycin biosynthesis pathway of Streptomyces lincolnensis (85),
which provide hints about ecological roles of the Acidobacteria. The bacteriorhodopsins couple light-energy harvesting with carbon-cycling in the
ocean through nonchlorophyll-based pathways, and the new homologue was ex-
pressed in E. coli and shown to bind retinal and form an active, light-driven,
proton pump. Most environments contain com-
munities far too complex for it to be possible to sequence a complete metagenome,
and even the simple communities contain microheterogeneity that makes most
genome reconstructions simpliﬁed versions of reality. 16) described a metagenomic analysis of
marine phage collected at two locations. In total, almost 2000 viral sequences
were obtained. To sequence the genomes of the uncultured Bacteria and Archaea in
the bioﬁlm, Tyson et al. ( They partitioned the community into populations
and identiﬁed ﬁve sequence “bins”: high G + C scaffolds with 3x and 10x cover-
age, low G + C scaffolds with 3x and 10x coverage, and short scaffolds with poor
coverage. 115) conducted a massive sequencing project focused on the mi-
crobiota of the nutrient-limited Sargasso Sea, an intensively studied marine en-
vironment. Therefore, examining a phosphorus-limited

Annu. Once genomes have been reconstructed, one rrn operon per genome
is sufﬁcient to determine the phylogenetic afﬁliation of the source of the genes
in the genome, but in the absence of metagenome reconstruction for an entire
environment, phylogenetic anchors that are found at frequent intervals in genomes
are essential. 20 Oct 2004 18:0

Strategies for library construction vary depending on the intended study of the
resulting library. Libraries containing large DNA fragments are constructed in
lambda phage, cosmid, fosmid, and BAC vectors. Although increasing the
library size is a worthy goal, existing libraries have provided useful insights into the
microbial ecology of several ecosystems in the absence of complete metagenome
coverage. Although both reconstruction studies reported
sequences from Archaea, which are notoriously difﬁcult to lyse, the Sargasso Sea
study did not report members of the phyla containing only uncultured organisms,
so the effect of the DNA extraction on the diversity of DNA in the metagenomic
libraries method remains unclear. Finally, libraries can be screened with taxon-speciﬁc oligonucleotide probes and

variation on FISH is to link it with microautoradiography to identify taxons that
utilize particular substrates in natural microbial communities (40, 62, 76). B´ej`a O, Suzuki MT, Koonin EV, Aravind
