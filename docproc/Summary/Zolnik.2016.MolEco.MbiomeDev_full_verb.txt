A preliminary report by the Institute of Medicine
Committee on Lyme Disease and Other Tick-Borne Dis-
eases examined the diversity of prokaryotes in three
tick species (Amblyomma americanum, Dermacentor vari-
abilis and Ixodes scapularis) using 454 pyrosequencing
technology (Clay & Fuqua 2010). For
example, infection of blacklegged ticks by A. phagocy-
tophilum (the causative agent of granulocytic anaplas-
mosis in humans) has been shown to induce protein
expression that increases cold tolerance and, depend-
ing on weather patterns, may aid in tick survival
(Neelakanta et al. In addition to investigating the internal
microbial communities found within whole ticks, we
focused on the microbiomes within two speciﬁc tissues
in adult female ticks, salivary glands and the midgut,
as these are important for maintenance and transmis-
sion of many tick-borne pathogens associated with
I. scapularis (Spielman et al. This primer set, resulting in a 450- to 550-bp PCR pro-
duct, was determined to be the best candidate among
512 sets tested in terms of domain and phylum cover-
age for use in 16S rRNA bacterial sequencing (Klind-
worth et al. A subset of
the PCR products for all
sample pools and the one negative were indexed
using 25 lL KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR Master Mix
(Kapa Biosystems), 10 lL sdH2O, 5 lL Nextera XT
Index 1 Primer, 5 lL Nextera XT Index 2 Primer and
5 lL puriﬁed PCR product. The UPARSE pipeline includes de novo chi-
mera removal, followed by referenced-based chimera
removal using the UCHIME algorithm and the GOLD
16S rRNA gene database (Reddy et al. First, we
isolated 4 315 478 sequences matching the genus Rick-
ettsia using the ‘ﬁlter_fasta.py’ script in QIIME and col-
lapsed them into 91 519 unique sequences using FASTX-
(Gordon 2011). The remaining OTUs were
