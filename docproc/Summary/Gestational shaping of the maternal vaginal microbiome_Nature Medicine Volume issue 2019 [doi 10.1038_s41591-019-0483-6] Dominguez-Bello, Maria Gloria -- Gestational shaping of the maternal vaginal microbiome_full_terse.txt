Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology Vol. -, Although the link between smoking and
disease has been well established, several studies have
emerged over the last several years that explore the in-
ﬂuence of smoking on the oral, esophageal, and gastric
microbiome.101 Within the mouth, smokers tend to have
an increase in anaerobic bacteria leading to shifts in a
community that possibly favors pathogenic microbes.101
In regards to the intestinal microbiome, mouse models
and human studies have indicated that smoking can
affect microbial composition and intestinal inﬂammation. Satokari R, Grönroos T, Laitinen K, et al. Determinants of the human
