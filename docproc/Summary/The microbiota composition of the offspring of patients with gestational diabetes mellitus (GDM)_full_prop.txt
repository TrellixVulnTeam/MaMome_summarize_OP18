The present study conforms to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. ADONIS and ANOSIM statistical test were used
to detect significant differences in the overall microbial community by using the unweighted
UniFrac distance matrices or OTU table. Multiple regression analyses were performed to evaluate the associations between infant
microbial taxa abundance (dependent variable) and maternal nutrient intakes or laboratory
variables, after adjusting for gestational weight change, breastfeeding and Cesarean section
(Statistica, ver. The correlation plot between
maternal nutrient intakes and infant gut microbiota showed a higher number of significant
associations with maternal variables at enrolment than at the study-end (Fig 3). In a multiple regres-
sion model, after adjusting for weight change, breastfeeding and Cesarean section, associations
between infant Ruminococcus with maternal oligosaccharide (positive association) and with
maternal intake of SFA (inverse association) were found, even if not reaching the defined
cutoff of p-values. Statistically significant associations between infant microbiota composition and maternal variables by Spearman’s correlations for continuous variables
(left) and multiple regression analyses (right). Ten out of the 29 (34.5%) newborns were breastfed by their mothers, while 19 (65.5%)
were formula-fed. Gut microbiota signature at sub-genus level

In order to explore the possible mother-to-infant gut microbiota transmission at sub-OTUs
level, we carried out oligotyping on sequences of Blautia, Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium
since these were the only genera showing a Shannon entropy index sufficient to identify all

found to be higher in the meconium of babies from T2DM mothers [24]. Furthermore, Para-
bacteroides have been reported to be enriched in GDM patients when compared to healthy
subjects [18]. In our previous study [17], we have observed an increased, though not

statistically significant, relative abundance of Parabacteroides across pregnancy from enrol-
ment to study end. Nutritional recommendations were given to our women between 24–28 weeks of gesta-
tional age, at the time of the oral glucose challenge test and GDM diagnosis [17]. Only 34.1%
of our participants resulted compliant to the nutritional advice; indeed, dietary adherence and
nutritional habits at the end of pregnancy did not influence the offspring microbiota. This hypothesis needs
to be confirmed by further studies. Heat-plot of the abundances of OTUs at genus level. Heatplot showing OTUs of
