the commonality that relates both BV and vaginal pH to HPV
infection (independent of HIV) is the RA of certain Lactobacil-
lus species, most notably L. crispatus. Last, despite considerable spec-
ulation that cervicovaginal pH may mediate the effects of the
microbiota on HPV infection, no studies have, to our knowl-
edge, assessed whether statistical control for pH weakens the
HPV-microbiota association, which would be expected if pH
was part of the causal pathway. WIHS Substudy Population
As described previously [10], women included in the micro-
biome substudy were selected from among premenopausal
African American participants at the Chicago WIHS site,
with at least 8 years of observation and a minimum of 6 annual
CVL specimens, with further selection based on their HIV sta-
tus and CD4+ T-cell count over time. Microbial DNA was isolated using the FastDNA Spin Kit for
Soil (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH). Distribution of relative abundance (RA) of Lactobacillus species. It is a highly efﬁcient analytic method, widely
used in HPV research [30, 31]. In addition to CSTs, we conduct-
ed a priori–planned analyses of the RA of lactobacilli (at the
genus and species level), modeled as both continuous and ordi-
nal data. All covariates except study group were time
dependent. RESULTS

performed as described previously [8, 10]. Brieﬂy, universal
primers 27F and 338R were used for PCR ampliﬁcation of the
V1-V2 hypervariable regions of 16S rRNA genes from genomic
DNA extracts. Detection of chimeric se-
quences was performed using the UCHIME component of
UCLUST, and chimeric sequences were removed. Statistical Methods
We characterized demographic and risk factor data at the index
visit for each of the 3 study groups, with statistical differences
between groups assessed using analysis of variance (ANOVA;
for continuous variables), the Kruskal–Wallis test (for continu-
ous variables with nonnormal distributions), or the χ2 test (for
categorical data). of male sex

median of all pH values >4.5) was considered high. On the other hand, bacteriocins produced by
L. crispatus may have antiviral effects. For

All models were adjusted for age, study group, highly active antiretroviral therapy use, number of recent sex partners, smoking status, condom use, lifetime sex partners, Trichomonas vaginalis
infection in the past 6 months, Candida infection in the past 6 months, or other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the past 6 months. In summary, our results suggest a beneﬁcial effect of L. crisp-
atus on the burden of HPV in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected
women that is unrelated to pH. Further research to better un-
derstand these relationships is strongly warranted, including
large prospective cohort studies and laboratory research to un-
derstand the mechanisms that underlie the relation of the cer-
vicovaginal microbiota with HPV infection. The WIHS is funded primarily by the NIAID, with additional
