COMPOUNDS: DETECTION METHODS
AND DATA ANALYSIS

Metabolomics uses high throughput techniques to characterize
and quantify small molecules in several bioﬂuids (urine, serum,
plasma, feces, saliva), revealing a unique metabolic signature
(Nicholson and Lindon, 2008). Considering
that the amount of predictable metabolites and derivatives in
mammals, plants and bacteria is unknown (Weckwerth and
Morgenthal, 2005), there is the need of diﬀerent analytical
platforms and complex integrated computational pipelines,
to cover
adjusted by analytical and chemical parameters,
complete metabolome pathways
in the diﬀerent bioﬂuids

Bacterial Metabolism
SCFAs
Several substances present
including
indigestible oligosaccharides, dietary plant polysaccharides or
ﬁbers, non-digested proteins and intestinal mucin are fermented
by the microbiota populations to produce SCFAs (Arora and
Sharma, 2011). 2015)
found that inulin-propionate ester administrated to overweight
adults signiﬁcantly reduced weight gain, intra-abdominal adipose
tissue distribution, and intrahepatocellular lipid content, and
improved insulin resistance in the inulin control group. Furthermore, other clinical studies demonstrated that the
administration of SCFAs has a positive eﬀect on the treatment
of ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease, and antibiotic-associated
diarrhea and obesity, metabolic syndrome, bowel disorders, and
cancer (Harig et al., Vitamin B8 is contained in raw egg yolk, liver, peanuts and
green leafy vegetables. Green leafy vegetables such as spinach, egg
yolks, and liver contain vitamin K.

Bacterial-Transformed Compounds
Bile Salts
The metabolism of bile salts is a well-known and basic skill of the
gut microbiota metabolism, particularly associated to the genera
of Bacteroides, Clostridium, Lactobacillus, Biﬁdobacterium,
Enterobacter, Eubacterium, and Escherichia (Ridlon et al., 2001; Taverniti and Guglielmetti, 2012; Amaretti et al., It was
also observed, using 1H-NMR spectroscopy, that AAs in CD
patients with active disease showed a diﬀerent proﬁle (i.e.,
alanine, isoleucine, leucine, and lysine) compared to CD patients
in remission (Marchesi et al., Furthermore, Kidd (2002) found that subjects with ASD
together with their non-ASD siblings, presented with a deep
alteration in the tryptophan–nicotinic acid and sulfur metabolic
pathways (Kidd, 2002; Oresic et al., doi:
