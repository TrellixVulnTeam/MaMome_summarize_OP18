(Online  Methods  and  Supplementary  Note  1)  to  ensure  that  the 
reconstructions meet the quality standards set by Thiele and Palsson 
(2010)9. When comparing eight AGORA reconstructions with the published 
genome-scale metabolic reconstructions for the same species, we found 
that the main differences in reaction content were in lipopolysaccha-
ride biosynthesis and transport pathways (Supplementary Tables 7  
and  8). The AGORA models have been curated for carbon source utilization 
and fermentation product secretion; they outperformed the published 
models for those functions, as measured by a sensitivity analysis of 
the carbon source uptake and fermentation product secretion of both 
seven published models and AGORA models (Supplementary Fig. Validation of AGORA model predictions
We demonstrated the predictive capability of AGORA models using 
two  models,  Bacteroides  caccae  ATCC  34185  (a  fiber-degrading 
symbiont common in microbiomes of Western individuals29,30) and 
Lactobacillus  rhamnosus  GG  (LGG),  a  common  human  probiotic
