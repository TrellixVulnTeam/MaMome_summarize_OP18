infant nutrition, and common clinical practices in neonatal
care [14–20]. We hypothesize that assembly and function
of the preterm infants’ gut microbiota is associated with
postnatal growth patterns and represents a yet unexplored
personalized therapeutic potential for optimizing infant
development. In comparison, evaluation of fecal microbiota col-
lected as matched stool and swab samples in other studies
demonstrated by composition and diversity metrics that
microbiota from both samples is nearly identical [24, 25].
Based on similarity of alpha diversity and the ability of
clinical NICU staff to collect and store samples directly
from infants at specific times without cross contamination
from infant diapers and skin, we selected rectal swabs as
the preferred method for sampling gut microbiota. Third, in both the phase- and period-based
models, the abundance of several dominant infant gut
microbiota taxa (e.g., Bifidobacterium) [37, 53] were signifi-
cantly affected by gestational age at birth, PMA at sam-
pling, total calories and proportions of macronutrients
consumed at the week of sampling, and multiple clinical
variables. ZIP 536 kb)
