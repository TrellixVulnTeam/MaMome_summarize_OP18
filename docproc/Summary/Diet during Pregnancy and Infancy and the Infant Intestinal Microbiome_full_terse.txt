Trial enrolled 881 pregnant women at 3 clinical sites in the US
(Boston, Massachusetts; St. Louis, Missouri; and San Diego,
California). However, after adjusting
for demographic variables (mode of delivery, age, treatment,
maternal education, and race/ethnicity), breastfeeding vs
formula feeding and solid food introduction, the only asso-
ciation between the maternal diet and taxa selected a priori
for analysis was a positive association with Lactobacillus spp
(mean difference = 0.48; P = .02). We found that
Biﬁdobacterium spp counts were similar among breastfed and
formula-fed African American infants, and Hispanic and white
breastfed infants had higher levels of Biﬁdobacterium spp com-
pared with formula-fed Hispanic and White infants (African

Table IV. In an ethnically homogeneous population using targeted
quantitative polymerase chain reaction on stool samples col-
lected at age 1 month, Penders et al showed breastfed infants
had less Clostridia difﬁcile compared with formula-fed infants.7,30
This contrasts with our ﬁnding of a positive association between
breastfeeding and overall Clostridia spp, though we expect that
the inﬂuence of breastfeeding differs among individual species
within this genus. Litonjua AA, Lange NE, Carey VJ, Brown S, Laranjo N, Harshﬁeld BJ, et al. Similar to the above, we used question-
naire responses obtained at 6 months to determine whether
a child was ingesting formula at the time of stool collection.
