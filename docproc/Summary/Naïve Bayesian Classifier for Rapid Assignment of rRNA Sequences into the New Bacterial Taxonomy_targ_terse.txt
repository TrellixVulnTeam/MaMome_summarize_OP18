Small-subunit rRNA sequences con-
sisting of 5,014 bacterial species type strain sequences in 988 genera (Table 1),
along with associated taxonomic assignment information, were obtained from
Bergey’s Taxonomic Outline of the Prokaryotes (release 5.0   The
sequences averaged 1,460 bases in length and had a range of 1,200 to 1,833 bases. These sequences formed the Bergey corpus. Each sequence was labeled with
a set of taxa from domain to genus. There are occasional intermediate ranks such as “sub-
class” and “suborder”..

Using the RDP 9 alignment  we extracted segments cor-
responding to 100-base regions of the Escherichia coli refer-
ence sequence J01695 at 25-base intervals and used each re-
gion independently for exhaustive leave-one-out
testing,
removing the corresponding full-length sequence from training
for each test. The av-
erage bootstrap conﬁdence estimate was similarly higher in the
hypervariable regions ..

FIG. In 2005, S.
thermosulﬁdooxidans strain K1 was reclassiﬁed as the type strain of a
new species, A. tolerans  In our analysis, however, the sequence for
K1 given in the naming paper (accession number AF137502) is 8%
different from that for Z21979.
