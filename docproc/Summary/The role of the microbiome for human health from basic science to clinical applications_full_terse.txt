Crohn’s disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC); and irritable 
bowel syndrome (IBS). Caco-2 cells promoted the growth and metabolism of 
the anaerobic F. prausnitzii, while genes involved in inflam-

by F. prausnitzii [80].

Anti-oxidants  including  riboflavin  and  vitamin  C  are 
being investigated as new targets for intervention for the 
treatment of dysbiosis. These mice

of the microbiome-gut-brain axis for normal neurological
