First we explored in detail the in vitro inhibitory effects of a selection of LGC strains against growth and 
pathogenic properties (adhesion to vaginal cells and hyphae formation) of Candida albicans. It is increasingly 
appreciated that a combination of targeting both the inhibition of pathogenic growth and virulence factor expres-
sion has superior efficacy in eliminating pathogens15. We examined the vaginal microbiome over four weeks: before, during, and after the 
use of the probiotic gel and compared the group requiring rescue medication (RM; 3 Ã— 200 mg fluconazole) with 
the group not requesting this antifungal treatment..

Concentrations of produced lactic acid  to 20.22 g/L (L. 
pentosus KCA1). Subsequently, we evaluated whether L. plantarum 
WCFS1, L. pentosus KCA1 and L. rhamnosus GG formulated in the gel were able to modulate the vaginal micro-
biome over a four-week period in 20 patients suffering from acute VVC . e) Adhesion of C. albicans to VK2/E6E7 cells either 
alone or in co-incubation with lactobacilli as percentage of adherent cells to total applied cells. ( Seven of the most dominant LGC ASVs matched with the four species typically observed in the 
vaginal microbiota, more precisely L. iners (LGC 1, 4 and 8), L. crispatus (LGC 2 and 9), L. gasseri (LGC 3) and L. 
jensenii (LGC 6).
