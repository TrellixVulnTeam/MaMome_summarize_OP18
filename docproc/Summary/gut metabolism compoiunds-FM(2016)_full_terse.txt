COMPOUNDS: DETECTION METHODS
AND DATA ANALYSIS

Metabolomics uses high throughput techniques to characterize
and quantify small molecules in several bioﬂuids (urine, serum,
plasma, feces, saliva), revealing a unique metabolic signature
(Nicholson and Lindon, 2008). Considering
that the amount of predictable metabolites and derivatives in
mammals, plants and bacteria is unknown (Weckwerth and
Morgenthal, 2005), there is the need of diﬀerent analytical
platforms and complex integrated computational pipelines,
to cover
adjusted by analytical and chemical parameters,
complete metabolome pathways
in the diﬀerent bioﬂuids
