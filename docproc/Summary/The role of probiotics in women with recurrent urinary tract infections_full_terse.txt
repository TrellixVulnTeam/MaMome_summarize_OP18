Among  these  treatment  approaches,  probiotic  applications  are 
among the promising alternatives. UM reported in healthy women is summarized in 
Table 1.[12-15] 

Thanks  to  16S  rRNA  sequencing  and  advanced  quantitative 
urine  culture  (EQUC)  techniques  developed  in  recent  years, 
aerobic and anaerobic bacteria colonized in normal flora in the 
urinary system have been detected.[11,12] Bacterial isolation can 
be performed using EQUC method in 80% of the cases reported 
as  ‘no  growth’  in  standard  cultures  of  urine  samples.[13] These 
bacteria  in  the  urinary  system  have  an  important  role  in  the 
health and balance of the urinary system. ”[25] The proper-
ties that a good probiotic should have are indicated in Table 2.[25]
