Competing interests: The authors have declared
that no competing interests exist. Two dieticians checked all questionnaires for completeness, internal coherence
and plausibility [17].

Patients were considered to be compliant to the given dietary recommendations in the pres-
ence of all the following criteria: at least 20 g/day fiber consumption (or increasing fiber intake
more than 50% than enrolment), sugar reduction to less than 10% of total energy and abolition
of alcohol intake. Statistically significant associations between infant microbiota composition and maternal variables by Spearman’s correlations for continuous variables
(left) and multiple regression analyses (right). We observed a non-significant reduction in microbial richness in breastfed
infants when compared to infants fed with artificial milk. Gut microbiota signature at sub-genus level

In order to explore the possible mother-to-infant gut microbiota transmission at sub-OTUs
level, we carried out oligotyping on sequences of Blautia, Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium
since these were the only genera showing a Shannon entropy index sufficient to identify all

GDM offspring gut microbiota composition

Fig 5. Accord-
ingly, these bacteria have been detected in the feces or meconium of full-term newborns in
several studies [24,34,35–37,39,44–48].

A distinct microbial composition was found in our breastfed GDM offspring when compar-
ing them with breastfed neonates from healthy controls, consistent with literature [16,24–25].
In particular, a significantly higher relative abundance of Escherichia and Parabacteroides was
found in our GDM infants. Con-
trarily to a few previous human studies showing that the infant gut microbiota was associated
with the last-trimester maternal diet [61], we found stronger associations between infant gut
bacteria composition and early maternal nutrition. Validation: Ilario Ferrocino, Rosalba Rosato, Simona Bo. Microbiol Mol
