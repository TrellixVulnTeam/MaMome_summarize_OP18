rates of cell turnover in germ-free animals compared with wild-type animals13. Infection by the Gram-positive
intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes results in decreased bacterial clearance in
germ-free compared with colonized animals19.The mechanism for this increased
susceptibility has been attributed to a T cell trafficking defect in germ-free animals to the
site of Listeria infection. These studies support the idea that enteric pathogens
such as S. typhimurium may have developed strategies to counter both the immune system
and the microbiota during the infectious process..

In the early 1900s, Ilya Mechnikov was the first to propose the use of live microorganisms
to maintain bowel health and prolong life. These data have identified a single molecule made by a
symbiotic microorganism that stimulates CD4+ T cells to make IL-10, required for the
suppression of the inflammatory process during colitis, and suggest that other beneficial
bacteria may produce factors that can positively shape the host immune response during
IBD..

Does harboring certain strains of bacteria predispose an individual to disease or protect from
it?
