2014) and mammalian carni-
vores (Menke et al. Although the report
provided useful insight into the microbiomes of adults
of these three species, it primarily emphasized the over-
all gap in knowledge regarding the identity of microor-
ganisms and the roles that microbial communities play
in pathogen transmission, infectivity and pathogenicity
within tick vectors (Clay & Fuqua 2010). In addition to investigating the internal
microbial communities found within whole ticks, we
focused on the microbiomes within two speciﬁc tissues
in adult female ticks, salivary glands and the midgut,
as these are important for maintenance and transmis-
sion of many tick-borne pathogens associated with
I. scapularis (Spielman et al. At a rar-
efaction depth of 200 000 sequences, whole females
exhibited the highest a-diversity for observed number
of OTUs and phylogenetic diversity, with female mid-
guts exhibiting the lowest measures (Fig. Carpi G, Cagnacci F, Wittekindt NE et al. ( Applied and
