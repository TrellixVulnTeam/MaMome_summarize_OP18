of intravaginal nonoxyl-9 (an ingredient in spermicide and a commonly used cytotoxic control) and univer-
sal placebo gel (isotonic) found that both have inflammatory effects on cells of the cervix and endometrium12. We evaluated the in vitro effect of lubricants, moisturizers and a pH balancing gel on the 
growth of clinical and lab strains of E. coli and a common vaginal Lactobacillus spp. When exposed to a 
1:100 dilution of KY Jelly, Replens Long-Lasting moisturizer, or Trimo-San in KSF, the laboratory strain of E. coli 
was inhibited compared to a KSF media control (p = 0.01, Fig. L. crispatus growth was stimulated by Replens Silky Smooth (p < 0.01). b) Final change in growth of 
L. crispatus, as measured in CFU (in 1:100 diluted product and MRS/KSF cell culture media as control), 
demonstrating a lack of inhibition by KY Jelly, Replens Long-Lasting moisturizer and Trimo-San, regardless of 
the presence of human vaginal epithelial cells (p > 0.05). One possible explanation for the difference in E. coli inhibition 
in the presence of cells involves the ability of bacteria to adhere to and proliferate on epithelial cell surfaces17. At the 1:100 dilution no products 
inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus spp., The bacterial species used in these experiments include a laboratory strain 
of E. coli (ATCC 8739) and 6 clinical strains of E. coli provided by the Massachusetts General Hospital microbi-
ology lab, which had been isolated from women with cystitis. Scientific RepoRtS  |         (2020) 10:7625  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-63652-x

with agitation for 6 hours. OD600 measurements were taken at every 2 hours with a Biotek Gen5 plate reader 
(Burlington, VT). To test the observed interac-
tions in a more high-fidelity model, the vaginal products with the most significant inhibitory effects in simple 
co-culture were then co-cultured with bacteria in the presence of human vaginal epithelial cells. Vaginal epithelial cells were incubated overnight to achieve >90% 
confluence. After a 24-hour equilibration to allow vaginal cells to adhere to the plate and become confluent, 25 µL of the 
laboratory strain E. coli suspended in KSF were added to the vaginal epithelial cells with 75 µL of fresh KSF media 
and incubated for 1 hour. The experiment was simultaneously performed without vaginal cells, using 1:100 diluted prod-
ucts, KSF medium and bacterial suspension. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Received: 13 December 2019; Accepted: 21 March 2020;
