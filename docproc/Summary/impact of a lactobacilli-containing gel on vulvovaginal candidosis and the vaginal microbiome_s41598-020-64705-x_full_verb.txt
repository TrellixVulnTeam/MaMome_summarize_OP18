First we explored in detail the in vitro inhibitory effects of a selection of LGC strains against growth and 
pathogenic properties (adhesion to vaginal cells and hyphae formation) of Candida albicans. We examined the vaginal microbiome over four weeks: before, during, and after the 
use of the probiotic gel and compared the group requiring rescue medication (RM; 3 × 200 mg fluconazole) with 
the group not requesting this antifungal treatment. We screened our selection of LGC strains 
for direct growth inhibition against Candida (Fig. When applying the strains simultaneously with C. albi-
cans, the strains were able to reduce adhesion of C. albicans, e.g. L. pentosus KCA1 by 78.0% (Fig. Subsequently, we evaluated whether L. plantarum 
WCFS1, L. pentosus KCA1 and L. rhamnosus GG formulated in the gel were able to modulate the vaginal micro-
biome over a four-week period in 20 patients suffering from acute VVC (Fig. The participants were asked to 
administer 2.5 ml of gel by use of an applicator in recumbent position at bedtime. 36 out of 
80 samples (20 samples over 4 timepoints) showed a relatively low sequencing depth (fewer than 2000 reads over 
two cumulated technical repeats; Fig. The qPCR results 
showed that in general the estimated absolute fungal abundances were significantly lower for these visits (visit 
3 mean=7.4.103 CFU/ml and visit 4 mean=5.7.102 CFU/ml) as compared to visit 1 (mean = 1.1.105 CFU/ml, 
p = 0.005 and p = 0.0002 respectively, visit 2 mean = 3.8.104 CFU/ml, visit 2 vs. 4 p = 0.0009; Fig. Of note, when we stratified 
the samples in women who did or did not use RM, the following trend was observed: the women who used RM 
started off with a higher load of fungi and lactobacilli and ended with on average with similar fungal concen-
trations and lower concentrations of lactobacilli as compared to the women who did not use RM (Fig. This ASV showed a lower relative 
abundance than L. plantarum/pentosus (mean relative abundance at visit 2: 11.0% versus 37.9% of LGC 5). Evaluation of the microbiome of the samples through sequencing, microscopy and culture. An overview of the used micro-organisms can be found in Table 1. The lactobacilli-containing gel was devel-
oped in collaboration with the Belgian biotech company YUN nv (see ‘Competing interest’ statement). The vaginal lavage fluids obtained were stored fro-
zen at −80 °C until microbiome analysis, performed as described in De Boeck et al.37, with minor modifications. estimation of LGc and fungal concentrations using qpcR.  To supplement the microbiome data with 
estimations of absolute abundances of lactobacilli and yeast, the DNA samples obtained before were subjected to 
qPCR analysis, as described previously43. Data availability
