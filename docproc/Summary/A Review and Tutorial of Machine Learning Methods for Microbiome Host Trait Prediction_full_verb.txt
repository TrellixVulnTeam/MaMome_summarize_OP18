Machine learning deals with the creation and evaluation of
algorithms to recognize, classify, and predict patterns from data
(Tarca et al., The python code for implementation is on our site
(https://sites.google.com/ncsu.edu/zhouslab/home/software?). The result is a set of informative features, perhaps including
original OTUs along with higher-level aggregations of taxonomic
features, that can be utilized for downstream machine learning
(Oudah and Henschel, 2018). An ensemble of decision trees (or regression trees
for continuous y) is built by performing bootstrapping on the
dataset and averaging or taking the modal prediction from trees
(a process known as “bagging”)(Figure 1C), with subsampling
of features used to reduce generalization error (Ho, 1995). Neural Networks
Neural networks

network of nodes (“neurons”) with weights attached to each
edge in the network, which allows the network to form a
mapping between the inputs X and the outcomes y (Ditzler
et al., This process continues until the last hidden layer is connected

we focused on the 17 reported datasets that compared at least
two competing measures of prediction accuracy. and here we list
