Interventions
The treatment group received oral probiotic capsules con-
taining 2.5 billion CFUs each of L. rhamnosus GR-1and L.
reuteri RC-14, while the placebo group received identical
capsules containing excipients alone (Chr. Participants were instructed to take one
capsule daily until delivery and self-report compliance at
each study visit.25. two common neonatal
pathogens (Escherichia coli and Group B streptococcus),
and the composition of the vaginal microbiota..

There were no differences in characteristics of partici-
pants between the two groups at baseline (Table 1). A further group was charac-
terised by a diverse community, which included anaerobic
species and Gardnerella vaginalis (Figure 3)..

The aim of this trail was to compare the effects on the
vaginal microbiota of oral probiotic capsules containing
L. rhamnosus GR-1 and L. reuteri RC-14 versus placebo
taken orally from early pregnancy until delivery.
