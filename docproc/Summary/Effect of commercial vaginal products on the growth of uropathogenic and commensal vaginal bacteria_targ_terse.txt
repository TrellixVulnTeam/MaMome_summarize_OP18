of intravaginal nonoxyl-9 (an ingredient in spermicide and a commonly used cytotoxic control) and univer-
sal placebo gel (isotonic) found that both have inflammatory effects on cells of the cervix and endometrium12. After six hours of co-culture, both the laboratory strain and a representative clinical strain of E. coli (from a 
postmenopausal woman with cystitis) were similarly impacted by the tested products ..

To test the observed interactions in a more high-fidelity model, the vaginal products with the most significant 
inhibitory effects in simple co-culture were then co-cultured with bacteria in the presence of an immortalized 
vaginal epithelial cell line (VK2, ATCC, VA) grown in keratinocyte serum-free (KSF) media. L. crispatus growth was stimulated by Replens Silky Smooth (p < 0.01). Both formulations of 
Replens, and all products except coconut oil inhibited E. coli, suggesting that L. crispatus may be less susceptible 
than E. coli to antimicrobial effects of these products..

When we added cultured, immortalized vaginal epithelial cells to the model, we demonstrated less inhibition 
of E. coli by the products that had been most inhibitory in the co-culture without vaginal cells. At the 1:100 dilution no products 
inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus spp., For the L. crispatus suspensions, deMan, Rogosa Sharpe broth (MRS, BD Difco, Fisher Scientific, MA) was inoc-
ulated and incubated for 12 hours at 37 Â°C in an anaerobic chamber without agitation..
