which  supply  the  host  with  extra  energy  from  indigestible  food
components,  as  compared  with 
lean  animals. Similarly,  although  the  gap  between  humanized
mouse models and the human gut microbiota within its original host
needs to be acknowledged, these models provide unique possibilities
to manipulate the human microbiota and potentially assess causality
in the role of the gut microbiota in health and disease. More  recently,  another  study  employed  metagenomic
approaches to compare the gut microbiota composition of humans
and guinea pigs (Hildebrand et al., Kim, H. B., Borewicz, K., White, B. A., Singer, R. S., Sreevatsan, S., Tu, Z. J. and
Isaacson, R.  E. (2012). Composition
and energy harvesting capacity of the gut microbiota: relationship to diet, obesity and
time in mouse models.
