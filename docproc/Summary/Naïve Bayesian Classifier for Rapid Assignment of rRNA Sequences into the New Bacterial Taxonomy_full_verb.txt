/classiﬁer. Complete rRNA database sequences with NCBI’s taxonomy. All available
(23,095) near-full-length ((cid:1)1,200 bases) 16S rRNA sequences were obtained
from the January 2004 release of the RDP. From the corpus consisting of N se-
quences, let n(wi) be the number of sequences containing subsequence wi. By Bayes’ theorem, the probability that an un-
known query sequence, S, is a member of genus G is P(G¦S) (cid:2) P(S¦G) (cid:5)
P(G)/P(S), where P(G) is the prior probability of a sequence being a member of
G and P(S) the overall probability of observing sequence S (from any genus). Percentage of matching bootstrap assignments for
various query lengths for the Bergey corpus

a Frequency of most common assignments out of 100 bootstrap samplings. Both comparison results and classiﬁcation
assignments can be downloaded in text format and imported into a spreadsheet
program for further analysis. The process was
repeated for all sequences in the corpus. For these high-throughput experiments,
the RDP Classiﬁer can provide rapid taxonomic placement and
summary data, including the number of input sequences be-
longing to each taxon. 73, 2007

THE RDP CLASSIFIER

crepancies between the underlying (16S rRNA) phylogeny and
Bergey’s taxonomy. To identify an example of the sources of errors in the tax-
onomy, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of classiﬁcation
errors in the family Alicyclobacillaceae (Fig. Unlike the Seq-
Match nearest-neighbor classiﬁer, the RDP naı¨ve Bayesian
Classiﬁer uses information averaged over the entire genus and
hence is less inﬂuenced by individual misplaced training se-
quences. In 2005, S.
thermosulﬁdooxidans strain K1 was reclassiﬁed as the type strain of a
new species, A. tolerans (14). There is signiﬁcant congruence between the two tax-
onomies, and both are based, at least in part, on phylogenetic
principals. For exam-
ple, in one library of Acidobacteria environmental clone se-
quences, 72 of 77 sequences were classiﬁed with less than 80%
conﬁdence even at the phylum level (not shown). This
tool leverages the Classiﬁer to provide rapid comparison of
two samples, each containing up to 5,000 sequences. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
