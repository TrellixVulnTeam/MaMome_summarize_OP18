with Sanger sequencing or denaturing gradient gel elec-
trophoresis, have attempted to explore internal micro-
bial communities or identify endosymbionts in tick
species (Noda et al. Although the report
provided useful insight into the microbiomes of adults
of these three species, it primarily emphasized the over-
all gap in knowledge regarding the identity of microor-
ganisms and the roles that microbial communities play
in pathogen transmission, infectivity and pathogenicity
within tick vectors (Clay & Fuqua 2010). 2015); I. ovatus,
I. persulcatus and Haemaphysalis ﬂava in Japan (Qiu et al. 2013), underscores
how little is currently known about
the variety of
microbial species occurring in this vector and the
potential for more of these species ultimately to be
identiﬁed as pathogens. For
example, infection of blacklegged ticks by A. phagocy-
tophilum (the causative agent of granulocytic anaplas-
mosis in humans) has been shown to induce protein
expression that increases cold tolerance and, depend-
ing on weather patterns, may aid in tick survival
(Neelakanta et al. In addition to investigating the internal
microbial communities found within whole ticks, we
focused on the microbiomes within two speciﬁc tissues
in adult female ticks, salivary glands and the midgut,
as these are important for maintenance and transmis-
sion of many tick-borne pathogens associated with
I. scapularis (Spielman et al. A subset of

whole female ticks tended to cluster together, away
from the more divergent salivary gland samples, pre-
sumably due to the >98% relative abundance of Rick-
ettsia species in these two sample types. The higher
average relative abundance of Anaplasma (12.5%) and
Borrelia (7.2%) found in the salivary glands compared
to the midguts (<1% average relative abundance for
both bacterial genera) may be due to differences in
tissue tropism of known pathogens within these two
genera. This work was partially funded by
