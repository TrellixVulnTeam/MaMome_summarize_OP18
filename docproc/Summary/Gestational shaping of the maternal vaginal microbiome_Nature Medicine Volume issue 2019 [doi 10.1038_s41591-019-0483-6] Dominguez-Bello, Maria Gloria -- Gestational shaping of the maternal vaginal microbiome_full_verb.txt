Figure 1. These
sugar polymers are almost exclusively metabolized by
the gut microbiome28 and they can promote the growth
of key communities including Biﬁdobacterium spp.29
Biﬁdobacteria has been shown to inhibit the growth of
pathogenic organisms and improve barrier function in
the infant gut.30 In a mouse model, human milk oligo-
saccharides were found to be protective in the develop-
ment of autoimmune disease and obesity.31,32

There are clear differences in the composition of the
microbiome in infants who are breastfed versus those
who are formula fed. Although the link between smoking and
disease has been well established, several studies have
emerged over the last several years that explore the in-
ﬂuence of smoking on the oral, esophageal, and gastric
microbiome.101 Within the mouth, smokers tend to have
an increase in anaerobic bacteria leading to shifts in a
community that possibly favors pathogenic microbes.101
In regards to the intestinal microbiome, mouse models
and human studies have indicated that smoking can
affect microbial composition and intestinal inﬂammation. considering the modulation of

Clinical Implications of Altered
Human Microbiome

Although previous sections have shown how envi-
ronmental exposures, such as diet, stress, pets, and
medications, can affect the microbiome, perturbations in
the microbiome can also be a potential cause for disease
