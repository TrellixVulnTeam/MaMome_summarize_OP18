Lactobacillus crispatus  CTV-05  (Lactin-V,  Osel) 
is  a  live  biotherapeutic  product  that  contains  a 
naturally occurring vaginal strain of L. crispatus. Premenopausal women 18 to 45 years of age 
were screened for eligibility after providing writ-
ten  informed  consent  to  be  screened. Potentially eligible wom-
en completed a standard 5-day course of vaginal 
0.75% metronidazole within 30 days before the 
screening visit. Copyright © 2020 Massachusetts Medical Society. The 
data from the questionnaire are not reported here.) Statistical Analysis
The efficacy analyses were performed in several 
analysis populations. Post 
hoc  sensitivity  analyses  for  missing  data  were 
performed  to  calculate  risk  ratios  and  corre-
sponding  confidence  intervals;  the  hypothesis 
tests  were  performed  with  the  use  of  logistic-

regression  multiple  imputation,  under  the  as-
sumption  of  a  monotone  pattern  of  missing 
data.23,24 The results of the prespecified inten-
tion-to-treat  analyses  in  which  missing  data 
were  imputed  with  the  use  of  the  last-observa-
tion-carried-forward  method  were  included  in 
the final clinical trial report and were reported 
to ClinicalTrials.gov. More than half the participants reported a his-

*  Risk ratios were calculated with the use of logistic-regression multiple imputation, under the assumption of a mono-

tone pattern of missing data. The incidence and risk ratio for each vari-
able are provided in Table S3. Safety
After the exclusion of 1 participant in the Lactin-V 
group who did not receive any doses, 151 par-
ticipants  in  the  Lactin-V  group  and  76  partici-
pants  in  the  placebo  group  were  evaluated  for 
safety;  data  on  solicited  adverse  events  were 
missing for 11 and 10 participants, respectively, 
owing to early loss to follow-up. 3),  and  the  most  common  solicited  sys-
temic  adverse  events  were  abdominal  pain  or 
cramps,  headache,  and  frequent  urination. Median Concentration (log10 CFU/ml)

Trial Week

Figure 2. (The circles below the blue bar at week 4 represent outliers.) The size of each 
blue bar represents the interquartile range. A total of 7 participants (4 in the Lactin-
V group and 3 in the placebo group) had a severe 
grade 3 adverse event, one of which was reported 
as a serious adverse event (Lactin-V group) (Ta-
ble S9). Overall,  adherence  to  the  assigned 
treatment  was  high. T h e  n e w   e ng l a n d   j o u r na l   o f  m e dic i n e

24  weeks  of  follow-up. Among  women  with  a  history  of  bacterial 
vaginosis,  the  use  of  Lactin-V  after  treatment 
with vaginal metronidazole resulted in a lower 
incidence of recurrence of bacterial vaginosis at 
12 weeks than placebo. A data sharing statement provided by the authors is available
