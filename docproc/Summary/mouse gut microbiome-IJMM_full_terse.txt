given  ecosystem. The  community  was  stable  over  time,  was  vertically
transmitted  to  the  offspring,  and  has  also  been  used  as  a  back-
ground  microbiota  in  gnotobiotic  mice  to  investigate  the  role  of
mucin-degrading  Akkermanisa  muciniphila  in  Salmonella  enterica
Typhimurium  infection-driven  inﬂammation  (Ganesh  et  al., As  discussed  above,  gnotobiotic  models  col-
onized  by  human  gut  bacteria  are  suitable  for  testing  clinical
relevance,  but  they  may   be  problematic  for  establishment  of  mouse
models  with  deﬁned  microbiota  in  terms  of  colonization  efﬁcacy
and  regulation  of  host  physiology  (Chung  et  al., A  high  resolution  view  of
the  mouse  gut  microbiome  combined  with  well-curated  strains
and  genomes  collections  will  offer  unprecedented  opportunities
towards  the  establishment  of  standardized  mouse  models  and
towards  the  study  of  speciﬁc  bacterial  functions  based  on  the  asso-
ciation  of  mice  colonized  by  a  model  microbiota  with  one  strain
carrying  the  given  function,  which  is  less  artiﬁcial  than  mono-
colonization  of  germ-free  mice. Martz,  S.L.,  McDonald,  J.A.,  Sun,  J.,  Zhang,  Y.G.,  Gloor,  G.B.,  Noordhof,  C.,  He,  S.M.,
