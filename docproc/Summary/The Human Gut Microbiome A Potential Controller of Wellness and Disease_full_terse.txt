Gut Microbiome in Human Health

INTRODUCTION

The human microbiome comprises of collective genomes of
microbiota inhabiting us, namely protozoa, archaea, eukaryotes,
viruses and predominantly bacteria that live symbiotically on and
within various sites of the human body. Another

suggestion regarding the IBD-gut microbiome
link is the initial impairment in gut mucus barrier function
(either due to dysbiosis or other factors), resulting in elevation
of mucus-eating (mucolytic) gut microbial species, which in
turn aggravates the barrier function and stimulates severe

inﬂammatory response. Besides, administration
of prebiotics (fermentable polysaccharides) to stimulate growth
and metabolic activity of beneﬁcial protective gut microbes
such as butyrate-synthesizing bacteria might be an attractive
concept to treat gastrointestinal inﬂammation in IBD (Joossens

Gut dysbiosis has been largely reported in celiac disease
patients,
in which the active phase of celiac disease is
characterized by a remarkable decrease in Gram-positive
bacteria, whereby this bacterial population is partly restored
in patients that receive gluten-free diet, suggesting the initial
reduction of the recovered species might be the secondary
consequences of the disease. doi: 10.1136/gutjnl-2013-304833
