Vieira et al. In mice, estrogen seems to modulate IL-1 production
and participate in the resistance of females to disseminating
dentoalveolar infections, leading to the enhanced localization
of these infections (Youssef and Stashenko, 2017), which draws
attention to the potential role of sex-related hormones in the
modulation of oral mucosal infections. We must mention that the gut microbiota may inﬂuence
the risk for breast cancer through eﬀects on endogenous
estrogens produced by adipose tissue in postmenopausal women
(Figure 1) (Key et al., However, another study compared 48
postmenopausal breast cancer patients and 48 control patients
and observed that postmenopausal women with breast cancer
exhibited an altered composition and estrogen-independent
low diversity of their microbiota (Goedert et al., doi: 10.1034/j.1600-051X.2003.00055.x
