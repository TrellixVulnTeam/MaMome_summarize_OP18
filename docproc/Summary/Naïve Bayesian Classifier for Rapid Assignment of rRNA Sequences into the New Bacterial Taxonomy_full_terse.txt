THE RDP CLASSIFIER

crepancies between the underlying (16S rRNA) phylogeny and
Bergey’s taxonomy. Unlike the Seq-
Match nearest-neighbor classiﬁer, the RDP naı¨ve Bayesian
Classiﬁer uses information averaged over the entire genus and
hence is less inﬂuenced by individual misplaced training se-
quences. Also, Seq-
Match has been shown to be more accurate than BLAST in
ﬁnding the most similar rRNA sequence as deﬁned by pairwise
aligned distance (8). Benson, D. A., I. Karsch-Mizrachi, D. J. Lipman, J. Ostell, B. A. Rapp, and

acidocaldarius, Bacillus acidoterrestris, and Bacillus cycloheptanicus and pro-
posal for creation of a new genus, Alicyclobacillus gen.
