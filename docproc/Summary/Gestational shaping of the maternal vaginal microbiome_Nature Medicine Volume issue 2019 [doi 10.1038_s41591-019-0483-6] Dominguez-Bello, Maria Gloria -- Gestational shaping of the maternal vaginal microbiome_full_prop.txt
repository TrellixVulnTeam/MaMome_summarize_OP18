Figure 1. Environmental factors shape and change the microbiome over time and perturbations can lead to disease. Acetate, propionate, and butyrate are
the major SCFAs, accounting for 90% of the total, with
ratios approximating 65:20:15.79 SCFA can affect gene
regulation and colonocyte proliferation and inﬂamma-
tion.80 In diversion colitis, a disease state characterized
by distal inﬂammation, the role of butyrate enemas as a
treatment highlights the importance of SCFA to colonic
health. Proton pump inhibitors and metformin are 2 notable
common examples, with more than 100 million users of
either medication in the United States alone.90,91
Through reduced acid production and hence higher
luminal pH, proton pump inhibitors have been shown to
alter the ﬂora of the stomach in chronic users and in-
crease the incidence of small bacterial overgrowth.92 In a
study examining individuals with type 2 diabetes, Wu
et al93 demonstrated that the introduction of metformin
strongly alters
the gut microbiome. Another study found that Biﬁdobacterium longum levels
were higher in fecal samples of infants with pet exposure
compared with those without and that the abundance of
B longum was inversely associated with the onset of
wheezy bronchitis. Another important environmental exposure
is smoking. considering the modulation of

Clinical Implications of Altered
Human Microbiome

Although previous sections have shown how envi-
ronmental exposures, such as diet, stress, pets, and
medications, can affect the microbiome, perturbations in
the microbiome can also be a potential cause for disease
(Figure 1). This section has
highlighted how certain microbial communities can lead
to certain end points, such as weight loss and patient
symptomology. Despite those gains, there is still much
more research to be done. The limitation of these studies is that they are
unable to clearly state if dysbiosis is a cause of disease or
merely a by-product. Gilbert
