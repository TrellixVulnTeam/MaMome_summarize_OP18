Competing Interests: The authors have declared
that no competing interests exist. Human gut harbors more than 100 trillion microbes referred to as the gut microbiota. Thus, the commensal gut
microbiota also had effects on the production of male sex hormone [18]. It is interesting to
explore the role of gut microbiota in PCOS, as the androgen level in PCOS women always ele-
vated. L rhamnosus GR-1 attenuated lipopolysaccharide-
induced inflammation in pregnant CD-1 mice [20]. Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM main-
tained insulin sensitivity in a metabolically heterogeneous group [21]. Lactobacillus rhamnosus
GG and Lactobacillus casei DN-114-001 protected epithelial barrier function against Escheri-
chia coli-induced redistribution of the tight-junction proteins [22, 23]. Fecal microbiota trans-
plantation (FMT) was introduction of fecal suspension derived from a healthy donor into the
gastrointestinal tract of a diseased individual. Control rat
fecal samples and PCOS rat fecal samples were used for DGGE analysis to evaluate the gut
microbiota shift in PCOS rats. Twenty four hours after the last dose of letrozole
(on day 22), PCOS FMT rats were administered a gavage of fecal supernatant with 2×109 fecal
microbiota, PCOS Lactobacillus transplantation rats were administered a gavage of 2×109 Lac-
tobacillus, the control rats and PCOS rats were administered a gavage of normal saline for 14
consecutive days. Then all rats were sacrificed by decapitation. On day
21, all rat fecal samples were collected. The specific primers were
showed in S1 Table. This bacterial solution was centrifuged at 5000 g for 3 min then the bacteria were col-
lected and resuspended in saline. Sensitivities of assays were 9.17 pg/mL, 4.75 pg/mL, 47.2 pg/mL, 46.2
pg/mL for estrone, estradiol, testosterone and androstenedione, respectively. Statistical analyses

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 15.0 software. A) DGGE profiles in the fecal microbiota of control group and PCOS group (control group: C1-C6; PCOS group:
P1-P6). B) Cluster analysis of the DGGE profiles. The dendrogram was constructed using UPGMA
method. ( Band 2 and 3 were identified as Prevotella mela-
ninogenica ATCC 25845 with 93% similarity, indicating that the DGGE gel separated V3 16S
rRNA genes from different bacteria effectively. As shown in Table 2, on day 36, the copy number of Lac-
tobacillus and Clostridium were increased in both FMT group and Lactobacillus
transplantation group, to levels similar to that of the control group. * p<0.05 results which are signiﬁcantly different versus control group

than that in Lactobacillus transplantation group. All control rats had regular
estrous cycles of 4–5 days, comprising proestrus, estrus, metestrus and diestrus. Estrous cycle changes in three representative rats from each group. Letrozole is a nonste-
roidal aromatase inhibitor that reduces conversion of androgens to estrogens in the ovary,
resulting in increased testosterone and decreased estrone production [30]. Decreased aroma-
tase activity in the ovary is one of the pathophysiologic hypotheses of PCOS development [31,

degenerating follicles with thin granulosa layers. ( Recently, letrozole-induced PCOS rat model was used in several papers to evaluate
effects of new therapeutic methods for PCOS [33, 34], which illustrated the recognition of this

Table 3. The results showed that after treating PCOS rats
with Lactobacillus transplantation and FMT, the serum androgens reduced, estrous cycles
improved and the ovarian functions normalized. We hope that this study could raise concerns about the important roles of gut microbiota
in the etiology and therapeutic effects in PCOS. 16S rRNA gene-targeted group-specific primers used in this study. Contributed reagents/materials/analysis tools: YJG.
