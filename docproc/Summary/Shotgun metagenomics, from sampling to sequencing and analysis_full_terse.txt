Step 1: Study design and experimental protocol, the importance of this step is 
often  underestimated  in  metagenomics. Profiling of the functional classes present in a metagenome is hindered by the lack of validated annotations for most genes, an issue 
that  can  be  mitigated  only  by  expensive  and  low-throughput  gene-specific  functional  studies. Metagenomic  assembly  is  the  preferred  theoretical 
solution if there is sufficient genome coverage (i.e. >20x), but this level of coverage is difficult to obtain for 
most  of  the  members  of  the  microbiome  (Table  4)  and  assembly-free  methods  have  other  advantages
