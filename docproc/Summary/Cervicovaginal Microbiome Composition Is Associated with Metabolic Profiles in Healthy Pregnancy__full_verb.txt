Oliver et al. KEYWORDS Lactobacillus, longitudinal, metabolome, microbiome, pregnancy, vagina

Vaginal microbes sustain important physiologies and produce metabolites that can

directly or indirectly affect maternal health and infant development during preg-
nancy. Postpartum,
irrespective of the mode of delivery, the vaginal
microbiota resembled that of a gastrointestinal microbiome, likely due to microbial
mixing during the birthing process (9), suggesting that both vaginal and gastrointes-
tinal microbial seeding of the neonate occurs. Keystone species include Lactobacillus crispatus and Lactobacillus gasseri, which have
been associated with maintenance of a simple vaginal microbiome by their production
of bacteriostatic and bactericidal compounds (e.g., lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide)
and maintenance of a low pH (14–16) numerically and functionally dominating their
respective vaginal communities. To account for repeated measures from longitudinal samples
from the same individual, we also performed an LME, which required dimensional
reduction (LME; R2 (cid:2) 69%; P (cid:3) 0.0001). July/August 2020 Volume 11 Issue 4 e01851-20

FIG 4 Relationship between vaginal microbes and metabolites. ( Indole-3-lactate (ILA) accounted for
27% of the variation observed in the vaginal microbiota data and was found to be more
abundant in vaginal microbiota with abundant L. crispatus (Fig. An nMDS of HUMAnN2 analysis, examining the abundance
of pathways in each microbiome (n (cid:2) 35 samples). Mothers and infants have signiﬁcantly different saliva and urine metabolomes. A subset of 50 lipidomics
metabolites with high mean abundance, 70% of which were unannotated, showed
distinct proﬁles between mother and offspring salivary metabolomes (Fig. The infant metabolome for saliva and urine
had little variance attributed to which subject donated the sample, but GC-TOF MS was
able to detect a signiﬁcant change between the infant urine metabolome at birth
versus 6 and 12 months of age (PERMANOVA; R2 (cid:2) 34%; P (cid:2) 0.0007; Table S2). Of note, vaginal microbiota instability throughout
pregnancy was associated with the presence of Candida, a known opportunistic
pathogen of the vaginal tract. We speculate that this high extracellular mannitol abundance
phenotype may underlie the cell’s need to regenerate NAD(cid:5) for use in glycolysis. Maternal urine was collected using a sterile collection cup. All urine, saliva, and CVF were analyzed using matrix-assisted laser
desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) for high-throughput untargeted metabo-
lomics. Aliquots of 100 to 200 (cid:2)l were added to lysing matrix
E tubes prealiquoted with 500 of hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) DNA extraction buffer
and incubated at 65°C for 15 min. Raw sequences (mean 2,977,881 paired-end reads per sample from 35/38
successfully sequenced samples) were ﬁltered using PRINSEQ v0.20.4 (69) to ﬁlter out sequences that had
a mean quality score of 30 or less. SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL
