The majority of these techniques are based on the extraction of DNA and the ampliﬁcation of the 16S
ribosomal RNA gene (rRNA) [5,6]. 16S rRNA sequencing has become the most useful technique to
highlight diversity and abundance of the microbiome. Clostridium genera represent
95% of the Firmicutes phyla. Microorganisms 2019, 7, 14

Figure 1. Examples of taxonomic gut microbiota composition. Microbiota variations within individuals are summarized in Table 1. and an increase in Clostridium and Proteobacteria have been observed [44].
Given the role of Biﬁdobacterium spp. Speciﬁc properties of antibiotics such as
antimicrobial effects or mode of action are powerful forces for the selection of intestinal microbiota
and are partially responsible for the shifts in bacterial composition during antibiotic therapy [46].

Each class of antibiotics has different properties and excretion systems, resulting in different

patterns of alteration in the microbiome composition [47].

A cultivation-independent survey of gut microbiota composition of three persons before, during,
and after two exposures to the same antibiotic (ciproﬂoxacin) [48] has been conducted. [14]

Furthermore,
Lactobacillus spp. Results showed that AN intestinal microbiota
showed a signiﬁcant increase in Enterobacteriaceae and Methanobrevibacter smithii compared with healthy
controls [55]. On the contrary, the genera Roseburia, Ruminococcus, and Clostridium were depleted in
line with the observed reduction in AN of the total SCFAs [55].

BMI levels represent a valid predictive value for gut microbiota dysbiosis. Interventions
such as prebiotics and probiotics may be possible solutions to manage both pediatric obesity [50] and
AN patients. Ethnicity, Dietary Habits, and Cultural Habits

While the microbiome of a healthy individual is relatively stable, gut microbial dynamics can
certainly be inﬂuenced by lifestyle and dietary cultural choices [56]. A study of European children
(fed with the Western diet) and Burkina Faso children (assuming a diet rich in millet/sorghum +
local vegetables containing very few lipids and animal proteins) [57] revealed that African children’s
microbiota have a remarkable abundance of Prevotella and Xylanibacter. Biﬁdobacterium longum, Clostridium
histolyticum, C. lituseburense, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii group proportions are less abundant in
untreated CD patients than in healthy controls. Recent advances in research have demonstrated that this mutualistic gut
microbiota–host relationship appears to play a critical role for many extra-intestinal diseases such
as metabolic diseases and neurological disorders with “gut–brain axis” interactions [81], but also
for complex multifactorial diseases such as age-related macular degeneration with “gut–retina axis”
interactions [82].
