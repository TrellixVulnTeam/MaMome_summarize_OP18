Oliver et al. Postpartum,
irrespective of the mode of delivery, the vaginal
microbiota resembled that of a gastrointestinal microbiome, likely due to microbial
mixing during the birthing process (9), suggesting that both vaginal and gastrointes-
tinal microbial seeding of the neonate occurs. A closely related species, Lactobacillus iners, has been
associated with health-promoting beneﬁts; however,
its genome also encodes the
capacity to promote microbiome perturbation by increasing vaginal pH and producing
species-speciﬁc virulence factors (14, 17–19). Saliva, urine, and
cervical vaginal ﬂuid (CVF) were collected from 18 women at early, middle, and late
pregnancy with the gestational age range of the included women at each time point
(Fig. Sixteen individuals (42 total samples) produced suf-
ﬁcient sequence reads for taxonomic assignment using the 16S rRNA gene. While some
individuals exhibited a relatively stable microbial community over time, others (6/16)
experienced shifts in composition, resulting in a statistically signiﬁcant change in
Bray-Curtis dissimilarity on PC axis 1 between trimesters (Fig. July/August 2020 Volume 11 Issue 4 e01851-20

FIG 4 Relationship between vaginal microbes and metabolites. ( Indole-3-lactate (ILA) accounted for
27% of the variation observed in the vaginal microbiota data and was found to be more
abundant in vaginal microbiota with abundant L. crispatus (Fig. In parallel, we found that
a pathway for mannitol-1-phosphate production is also more abundant in shotgun
metagenomic data sets of CVF samples dominated by L. crispatus (Fig. Mothers and infants have signiﬁcantly different saliva and urine metabolomes. PERMANOVA analysis of
lipidomics data from saliva samples showed the largest difference between mothers
and offspring (PERMANOVA; R2 (cid:2) 69%; P (cid:2) 0.001; Fig. The infant metabolome for saliva and urine
had little variance attributed to which subject donated the sample, but GC-TOF MS was
able to detect a signiﬁcant change between the infant urine metabolome at birth
versus 6 and 12 months of age (PERMANOVA; R2 (cid:2) 34%; P (cid:2) 0.0007; Table S2). Mantel tests to determine if intersample relationships were similar
between chromatography methods (including both GC-TOF MS and lipidomics)
showed a strong correlation between saliva samples and weaker correlations between
urine and CVF (Table S3). We speculate that this high extracellular mannitol abundance
phenotype may underlie the cell’s need to regenerate NAD(cid:5) for use in glycolysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS

Subject information. Infants were allowed to suck on the spear for 2 min, ensuring saturation. Each position accumulated 20 laser shots. The instrument was controlled
using the MALDI-MSI 4800 imaging tool. Aliquots of 100 to 200 (cid:2)l were added to lysing matrix
E tubes prealiquoted with 500 of hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) DNA extraction buffer
and incubated at 65°C for 15 min. The amplicon
library was concentrated using the Agencourt AMPure XP system (Beckman-Coulter), quantiﬁed using
the Kapa library quantiﬁcation kit (Kapa Biosystems), and diluted to 2 nM. Equimolar PhiX was added at
40% ﬁnal volume to the amplicon library; the 16S rRNA amplicon pool was sequenced on the Illumina
NextSeq 500 platform on a 153-bp by153-bp sequencing run, and the ITS2 amplicon pool was sequenced
on the Illumina MiSeq platform on a 290-bp by 290-bp run. Raw sequences (mean 2,977,881 paired-end reads per sample from 35/38
successfully sequenced samples) were ﬁltered using PRINSEQ v0.20.4 (69) to ﬁlter out sequences that had
a mean quality score of 30 or less. To analyze functional potential, the reads were run through HUMAnN2 v0.1.9 (71) using default
parameters, and differences in pathway abundances were analyzed using LEfSe (72). Metabolomics data for all samples can be found in Table S1. SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL
