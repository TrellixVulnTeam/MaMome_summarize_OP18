Gut Microbiome in Human Health

INTRODUCTION

The human microbiome comprises of collective genomes of
microbiota inhabiting us, namely protozoa, archaea, eukaryotes,
viruses and predominantly bacteria that live symbiotically on and
within various sites of the human body. Such antimicrobial

pathogens. 2014

glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1);

Production of nucleotides, vitamins and
amino acids. Several commensal microbes such as Bacteroides
fragilis, Biﬁdobacterium infantis, and Firmicutes are capable in
inducing expansion of Treg cells such as FOXP3 expressing
Treg and anti-inﬂammatory IL-10-producing Treg lymphocytes,
which are crucial

function (Paust et al., The observation of
decreased gut motility and lesser nNOS (neuronal NO synthase)
neurons had been demonstrated in GF and antibiotic-treated
mice, whereby such deﬁcits are reproduced in TLR4-knockout
mice as well as TLR signal transducer MyD88-knockout mice

can induce dysbiosis in gut microbiome. (cid:114)

Induce activation of T helper type 17
(TH17) cells without intestinal pathology,
enhancing resistance toward intestinal
pathogen. Although
our understanding on the mechanism of pathogenesis for this
disease is still lacking, crosstalk between gut microbiota and
host factors show great potential in contributing to the disease
development, as demonstrated in Figure 2. Gastrointestinal mucus
antimicrobial peptides (such as human defensins) secreted
from epithelium work together as a barrier in preventing direct
contact of luminal gut microbiota with gastrointestinal epithelial
cells and inhibit aberrant inﬂammation (Johansson et al., Besides, administration
of prebiotics (fermentable polysaccharides) to stimulate growth
and metabolic activity of beneﬁcial protective gut microbes
such as butyrate-synthesizing bacteria might be an attractive
concept to treat gastrointestinal inﬂammation in IBD (Joossens
et al., OF-IN intake induced a signiﬁcant
reduction in mucolytic Ruminococcus gnavus and a marked

elevation of beneﬁcial Biﬁdobacterium longum, which the latter
was strongly correlated with the clinical improvement in CD
disease activity (Joossens et al., tight

Gut dysbiosis has been largely reported in celiac disease
patients,
in which the active phase of celiac disease is
characterized by a remarkable decrease in Gram-positive
bacteria, whereby this bacterial population is partly restored

reduction of the recovered species might be the secondary
consequences of the disease. (cid:114)

with the aberrant

aberrant epitopes which are potentially immunogenic and
capable to interfere critical host cellular signaling, hence,
triggering manifestation of autoimmune disease such as celiac

the increased gut permeability induced by gliadin, and it
protects the healthy curvy appearance of epithelial tight junctions
from the unfavorable gliadin-induced “straightening” eﬀect on
tight junction in human colon Caco-2 cells (Lindfors et al., These obesity-associated
dysbiosis features were also accompanied by elevation in
starch-degrading glycoside hydrolase and SCFAs (butyrate and
acetate), and increased energy harvest capability as evidenced
by markedly decreased fecal energy in obese mice (Ley
