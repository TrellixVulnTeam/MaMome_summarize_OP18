FEMS Microbiology Reviews, 2016, Vol. Also of concern are the differences in func-
tional biochemical activities of the microbiota of mice raised
under SPF conditions or under conventional conditions (Norin
and Midtvedt 2010). However, cohousing of mice with dif-
ferent genotypes (e.g. wild type and knockout) has been shown
to change the gut microbial composition, affecting their natu-
ral immunological responses to a treatment or a disease trigger
(Garrett et al. Brinkman BM, Hildebrand F, Kubica M, et al. Site and strain-specific
variation in gut microbiota profiles and metabolism in ex-
perimental mice.
