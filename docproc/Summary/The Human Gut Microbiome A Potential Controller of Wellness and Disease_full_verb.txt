Gut Microbiome in Human Health

INTRODUCTION

The human microbiome comprises of collective genomes of
microbiota inhabiting us, namely protozoa, archaea, eukaryotes,
viruses and predominantly bacteria that live symbiotically on and
within various sites of the human body. (cid:114)
(cid:114)

Exhibit antimicrobial effects. Disrupted gut barrier function will increase gut
permeability to commensal microbes, microbial derived products
(such as metabolites, virulence factors) as well as other luminal
components, contributing to aberrant immune-inﬂammatory
response such as
inﬂammation, allergy, and autoimmune
disorder mediated by molecular mimicry and dysregulated T-cell
response (Barnaba and Sinigaglia, 1997). IBD generally involves
host factors combined with environmental factors (Franceschi
et al., Also, it has
been reported that each of these antibodies response patterns
highly correlates with distinctive clinical characteristics, disease
onset and severity, suggesting loss of diﬀerent microbiota species
that would aﬀect the gut barrier function and gut immunity,
results in diﬀerent degree of gut inﬂammation (Vasiliauskas
et al., Another

suggestion regarding the IBD-gut microbiome
link is the initial impairment in gut mucus barrier function
(either due to dysbiosis or other factors), resulting in elevation
of mucus-eating (mucolytic) gut microbial species, which in
turn aggravates the barrier function and stimulates severe

inﬂammatory response. Besides, administration
of prebiotics (fermentable polysaccharides) to stimulate growth
and metabolic activity of beneﬁcial protective gut microbes
such as butyrate-synthesizing bacteria might be an attractive
concept to treat gastrointestinal inﬂammation in IBD (Joossens
et al., Besides, inconsistent observation

Turnbaugh et al., Linking
the dysbiotic features, microbial-mediated PTMP activities
with the aberrant
immune-inﬂammatory response in celiac
disease, it is hypothesized that dysbiosis-mediated dysregulated
PTMP activities causing both functional and conformational
transformations of dietary and host proteins, generating novel
aberrant epitopes which are potentially immunogenic and
capable to interfere critical host cellular signaling, hence,
triggering manifestation of autoimmune disease such as celiac
disease (Lerner et al., Prebiotics
such as
inulin-type fructans that selectively nourish Roseburia and
Clostridium cluster XIVa, and arabinoxylan that increases the
abundance of Biﬁdobacterium, Roseburia, and Bacteroides, have
demonstrated anti-adipogenic eﬀect in high-fat-induced obese
mice (Dewulf et al., On the other hand,
another important component of human microbiome – the
human virome that is dominated by bacteriophage (viruses that
infect bacteria), is relatively less established compared to that
of commensal bacteriome research. Application of FMT, probiotic
and prebiotics derived from advances in gut microbiome
studies to ‘rectify’ or ‘restore’ the altered gut microbiota in
the dysbiosis-associated disease state back to the ‘healthy’
equilibrium, holds great promise as the alternative therapeutic
option in several symptomatic disease management. A phase I trial with transgenic bacteria expressing interleukin-10
