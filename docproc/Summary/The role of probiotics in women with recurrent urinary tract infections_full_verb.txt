Among  these  treatment  approaches,  probiotic  applications  are 
among the promising alternatives. UM reported in healthy women is summarized in 
Table 1.[12-15] 

Thanks  to  16S  rRNA  sequencing  and  advanced  quantitative 
urine  culture  (EQUC)  techniques  developed  in  recent  years, 
aerobic and anaerobic bacteria colonized in normal flora in the 
urinary system have been detected.[11,12] Bacterial isolation can 
be performed using EQUC method in 80% of the cases reported 
as  ‘no  growth’  in  standard  cultures  of  urine  samples.[13] These 
bacteria  in  the  urinary  system  have  an  important  role  in  the 
health and balance of the urinary system. Are the host and the 
bacteria  developing  all  together? Metchnikoff  notes  that  the  microbes  in  the 
digestive  system  can  provide  positive  contributions,  espe-
cially  in  the  digestive  system  diseases.[24]  The  World  Health 
Organization has defined probiotics as “useful living microor-
ganisms that have a positive effect on the health and physiology 
of a person when taken in sufficient quantities. following antimicrobial 
treatment

Recurrence rate was 73% in 
25 patients who received once 
weekly doses of vaginal ovules 
containing L. rhamnosus 
GR-1 ve L.reuteri B-54; 
79% decrease was observed 
in recurrence rates in 30 
patients who received once 
weekly doses of intravaginal 
lactobacillus growth factor 

The risk of UTI decreased 
significantly using fruit juice 
containing probiotic in 139 
patients diagnosed as acute 
UTI . The role of probiotics in women with recurrent urinary tract infections

Table 3. In the 3rd and 6th month controls, the response rates to treat-
ment were 72.2% and 61.1%, respectively. Researchers noted that 
the combination was well tolerated and effective. 382

The  reason  for  this  interest  is  the  desire  of  the  patients  to  be 
treated  with  natural  products  while  the  physicians  are  con-
cerned about the development of resistance against antibiotics. Author Contributions: Concept - T.A.; Design - T.A., T.K.; Supervision -
