and react to form a response, and understanding how these
responses combine to affect human health. However, although
these methods can be useful for checking the stability of
dominant members and clustering communities according
to these dominant members, they do not provide direct
phylogenetic identification and it is difficult to relate banding
patterns to changes in particular species (83, 84). Data can be transformed

have any penalty for increased complexity of the model. Zaheer R, Noyes N, Polo RO, Cook SR, Marinier E, Van Domselaar
