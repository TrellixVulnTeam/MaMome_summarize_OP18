['1 Comparison between 16S rRNA gene sequencing and shotgun metagenomic sequencing\n\nTwo primary methods for taxonomic proﬁling of microbial communities exist: 16S gene sequencing and whole genome shotgun sequencing (WGS).\nThe advantages and disadvantages of 16S gene sequencing versus WGS methods for the purpose of taxonomic proﬁling are listed in the following.\n\n1.1 Advantages of 16S rRNA sequencing\n\nCost: currently, 16S gene sequencing is signiﬁcantly more cost-eﬀective than WGS and requires less starting material than WGS
