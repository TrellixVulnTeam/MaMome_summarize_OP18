is diet, an element which we can control. Long-term consumption of this diet not only improved
the microbial proﬁle and actions of the gut inhabitants in obese men but also generated physiological
improvements in terms of metabolism [4,5]. In terms of feeding our gut microbiota “long-term” healthy
dietary patterns appear to be the key since short term dietary interventions of this nature have minimal,
if any, impact on microbiota diversity levels [6,7].

Interventions involving probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics and dietary ﬁbre also oﬀer opportunities
to “fertilize” our microbiota. In a later
study with the same probiotic strain, ﬁve months of supplementation to university athletes and game
players (n = 243) had no impact on upper respiratory tract infection symptoms which the authors state
could be attributable to the low incidence of such symptoms during the study [152]. The probiotic
was associated with plasma cytomegalovirus and Epstein Barr virus antibody titres which could be
interpreted as an improvement in immune status. Siddharth, J.; Chakrabarti, A.; Pannerec, A.; Karaz, S.; Morin-Rivron, D.; Masoodi, M.; Feige, J.N.;
