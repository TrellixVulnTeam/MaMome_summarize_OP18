the commonality that relates both BV and vaginal pH to HPV
infection (independent of HIV) is the RA of certain Lactobacil-
lus species, most notably L. crispatus. Self-report of Trichomo-
nas vaginalis infection, BV, candidiasis, or STIs within the past

. . . Lactobacillus species against STIs, most of that research
preceded widespread use of methods for comprehensively
assessing the cervicovaginal microbiome [11]. The growing ev-
idence of species-speciﬁc (eg, L. crispatus–related) relationships
between the cervicovaginal microbiome and HPV infection ar-
gues against a signiﬁcant role of pH, since production of lactic
acid is a common attribute of lactobacilli as a group, and our
data showed that the greatest association with pH was with
the RA of Lactobacillus species, not for L. crispatus RA or
CSTs dominated by L. crispatus. Mirmonsef P, Hotton AL, Gilbert D, et al.
