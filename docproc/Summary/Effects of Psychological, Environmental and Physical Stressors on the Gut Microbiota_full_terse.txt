All body surfaces are colonized by microbes, which oc-
curs through a dynamic process over the ﬁrst few years
of life. In that study, microbial colonization during
neonatal life was shown to be required to limit accumulation
of invariant NK T cells in the lung and colon, and this effect
was mediated through microbiota-mediated epigenetic regu-
lation of CXCL16 (24). Microbes ﬁne-tune hematopoiesis during steady-state

In addition to stimulation following early life colonization,
recent studies have shown that steady-state hematopoiesis can
be regulated by the commensal microbiota; this is likely im-
portant for ﬁne-tuning immunity (Fig. 2

Impact of microbial signals on HSC function and leukocyte longevity

The microbial factors that regulate myeloid cell production
and differentiation in the BM may also control their subse-
quent expansion and longevity after their export to the pe-
riphery. Greenwood, C., A. L. Morrow, A. J. Lagomarcino, M. Altaye, D. H. Taft, Z. Yu,
