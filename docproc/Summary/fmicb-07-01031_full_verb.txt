Pregnancy and the Microbiome

that we are born germ free (Tissier, 1900) and is still the belief
of many physicians, numerous pieces of evidence now cast
doubt on this hypothesis, and suggest that a bacterial presence
already exists in the feto-placental unit (Hu et al., Between-subject diversity (beta
diversity), is increased in the third trimester, coupled with weight
gain, insulin insensitivity, and higher levels of fecal cytokines,
reﬂecting inﬂammation (Koren et al., This study
found no dramatic changes during gestation or upon delivery in
gut microbiota composition or richness indexes (DiGiulio et al., A study in which probiotics were administered to
pregnant women 14 days before C-section revealed modulation
of the infant microbiota, implying an early maternal eﬀect on the
oﬀspring’s microbiota (Rautava et al., As in the gut, the vaginal microbiome undergoes signiﬁcant
changes during pregnancy, including a signiﬁcant decrease in
overall diversity, increased stability (the community composition
changes over time), and enrichment with Lactobacillus species

the emergence of microbiome research and the realization that
changes in the maternal microbiome compositions occur during
pregnancy, it has been suggested that there may be correlations
between the microbial communities present, and the health of the
pregnancy (Mysorekar and Cao, 2014). Although the eﬀects are not direct, it was
suggested that beyond the healthy changes related to pregnancy,
gut dysbiosis may induce pregnancy complications by impairing
maternal adaptation (Zhang et al., Alternatively, it was suggested that
hematogenous spread of oral microbes to the placenta might be
a driver of preterm birth (Aagaard et al., However,
none of
these studies directly tested the role of bacteria
colonizing the newborn in the development of disease. When comparing the gut, oral, and skin bacterial
communities of the C-section delivered babies, those exposed
to vaginal ﬂuids revealed signiﬁcantly more vagina-associated
bacteria, making their compositions more similar to vaginally
born infants. The most dominant bacteria in the colostrum (the ﬁrst milk
produced during late pregnancy, and contains antibodies)
included Weisella, Leuconostoc, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus,
and Lactococcus, whereas milk samples collected 1–6 months
post-partum harbored oral cavity related bacteria such as
Veillonella, Leptotrichia, and Prevotella, perhaps due to frequent
interaction with the infant’s oral microbiota (Cabrera-Rubio
