Competing Interests: The authors have declared
that no competing interests exist. Administration of probiotics such as Lactobacillus is an attractive
concept in combating various diseases. L rhamnosus GR-1 attenuated lipopolysaccharide-
induced inflammation in pregnant CD-1 mice [20]. Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM main-
tained insulin sensitivity in a metabolically heterogeneous group [21]. Lactobacillus rhamnosus
GG and Lactobacillus casei DN-114-001 protected epithelial barrier function against Escheri-
chia coli-induced redistribution of the tight-junction proteins [22, 23]. Fecal microbiota trans-
plantation (FMT) was introduction of fecal suspension derived from a healthy donor into the
gastrointestinal tract of a diseased individual. In this experiment, 32 female SD rats were randomly assigned into 4
groups of 8 rats each, including a control group that received a gavage of normal saline, and
three treatment groups (PCOS, PCOS FMT and PCOS Lactobacillus transplantation groups)
administered a gavage of letrozole (Novartis Pharma Schweiz AG, Switzerland) at a concentra-
tion of 1 mg/kg once daily for 21 consecutive days. On day 36, all rat fecal samples were collected for real-time PCR analysis. Then all rats were sacrificed by decapitation. To identify some separated and strong bands, bands were excised from
the gel and sequenced (Takara, Japan). Real-time PCR analysis

Enterococcus, Bacteroides, Enterobacteriaceae, Bifidobacterium and Clostridium genus in fecal
samples were chosen for further quantitative analysis on the basis of their important status in

Gut Microbiota for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome

Table 1. In order to verify the effects of FMT and Lactobacillus transplantation on the composition
of gut microbiota in PCOS rats, PCOS rats were treated with FMT or Lactobacillus and the bac-
teria described above were examined. * p<0.05 results which are signiﬁcantly different versus control group
# p<0.05 data are signiﬁcantly different versus PCOS group. Steroid concentrations

The serum estradiol and estrone concentrations were significantly lower in PCOS rats than
those in the control rats. et al
found that male germ free mice, unlike females, exhibited a significant high level of 5-hydroxy-
tryptamine and its metabolite in hippocampal compared with conventionally housed control
animals [28]. Collectively, these studies indicated the bi-direction regulation of gut microbiota
and endocrine systems. B) PCOS group showed cystic
degenerating follicles with thin granulosa layers. ( To further understand
effects of microbiota interventions on PCOS, PCOS rats were treated with FMT and Lactobacil-
lus transplantation. We hope that this study could raise concerns about the important roles of gut microbiota
in the etiology and therapeutic effects in PCOS. 16S rRNA gene-targeted group-specific primers used in this study. Contributed reagents/materials/analysis tools: YJG. Balen A. The pathophysiology of polycystic ovary syndrome: trying to understand PCOS and its endo-
