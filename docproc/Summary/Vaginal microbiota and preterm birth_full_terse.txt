Microbiome profiling was based on sequen-
cing of the cpn60 universal target, which provides higher
resolution than 16S rRNA variable regions [33] and al-
lows the resolution of Gardnerella vaginalis subgroups,
a hallmark bacteria in the disturbed microbiota [34].

Methods
Study population and sampling
This retrospective cohort study analysed the vaginal
microbiota of women who experienced spontaneous pre-
term birth (sPTB) and compared the resulting microbial
profiles to those of pregnant women who delivered at
term. This
observation is consistent with the results presented by
others [29, 30]. CST assignments are largely driven by
the dominance of a single species, which may mask dif-
ferences in rare taxa that would differentiate term and
preterm groups, and indeed, further analysis revealed
that the vaginal microbiota of women who experienced
preterm birth was richer and more diverse than those of
women who delivered at
term. Contrary to our overall findings, DiGiulio and col-
leagues [31] found a strong association between the

non-Lactobacillus-dominated CST IV and preterm birth
in a case–control study based on the 16S rRNA ampli-
con sequencing. Semin
