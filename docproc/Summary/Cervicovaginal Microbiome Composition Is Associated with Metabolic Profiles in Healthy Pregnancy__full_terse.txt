FIG 2 Taxonomy and alpha diversity of vaginal microbiomes during pregnancy. ( Indole-3-lactate (ILA) accounted for
27% of the variation observed in the vaginal microbiota data and was found to be more
abundant in vaginal microbiota with abundant L. crispatus (Fig. https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.3003605. Franzosa EA, McIver LJ, Rahnavard G, Thompson LR, Schirmer M, Wein-
