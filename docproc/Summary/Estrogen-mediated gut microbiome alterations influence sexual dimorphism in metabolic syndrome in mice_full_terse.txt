The causative role of the gut microbiota in the context
of MS is well characterized [14, 20, 21], but the role of
sexual
gut
microbiota in the context of MS, and the associated
mechanisms underlying such differences, are still un-
clear. Data with different superscript letters are significantly different (P < 0.05). Ordinary or repeated measures one-way ANOVA followed by Tukeyâ€™s multiple
comparisons test

index (Bray-Curtis distance) applied on whole microbiota
abundance identified a distinct clustering of microbiota
composition between male and OVX female and F/OVX
+E2/M+E2 groups along the primary ordination axis (axis
1), results are shown in Fig. Next, we employed PICRUSt to predict the
metagenomes and determine the changes in microbial
metabolic pathways (KEGG) across different groups [29].
Male/OVX groups were segregated from the other three
groups using PCoA applied on predicted functional path-
ways (Additional file 1: Figure S2c). 4) experiments contradict the protective effect of en-
dogenous estrogen against obesity in female mice, it is
well known that antibiotic usage [75] or gut dysbiosis [76]
impacts estrogen metabolism mediated by microbiota
Consequently, changes in circulating levels of estrogen
(Additional file 1 Figure S3m and Additional file 1:
Figure S4e) were found in female mice that received
male microbiota transplants or antibiotic treatment. Chambliss KL, Barrera J, Umetani M, Umetani J, Kim SH, Madak-Erdogan Z,
