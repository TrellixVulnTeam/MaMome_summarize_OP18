Competing Interests: The authors have declared
that no competing interests exist. FMT was more effective in elevating estradiol and estrone levels than Lactobacillus trans-
plantation as there was no significant difference between the FMT group and the control
group. et al
found that male germ free mice, unlike females, exhibited a significant high level of 5-hydroxy-
tryptamine and its metabolite in hippocampal compared with conventionally housed control
animals [28]. Collectively, these studies indicated the bi-direction regulation of gut microbiota
and endocrine systems. Letrozole is a nonste-
roidal aromatase inhibitor that reduces conversion of androgens to estrogens in the ovary,
resulting in increased testosterone and decreased estrone production [30]. Decreased aroma-
tase activity in the ovary is one of the pathophysiologic hypotheses of PCOS development [31,
