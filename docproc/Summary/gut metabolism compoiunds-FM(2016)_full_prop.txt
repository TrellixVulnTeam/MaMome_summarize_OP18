Gut Microbiota Metabolome

diseases may develop (Putignani et al., (i)
The “omics” technologies are presently applied to:
determine speciﬁc disease markers and novel diagnostic targets;
(ii) discover functional alterations in the physiopathology of
several diseases; (iii) discover the relationship between the gut
microbiota and the host metabolisms (De Preter and Verbeke,
2013). 2010), and new,
unexpected pathways which may have a key physiological role
(Zamboni et al., In fact,
the gut microbiota is involved in several biochemical functions
directly associated to the perturbation of speciﬁc gut microbial
populations, which may lead to the development of diseases
(De Preter, 2015; De Preter et al., The application of LC/MS allows the identiﬁcation of target
metabolites within a complex sample, not only with the
information about monoisotopic mass, but also providing advice
on the metabolite structure (Villas-Bôas et al., sample

Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
FT-IR spectroscopy allows rapid, non-destructive and high-
throughput determination of diﬀerent
In
particular, it can simultaneously detect diﬀerent molecules, such
as lipids and fatty acids (FAs), proteins, peptides, carbohydrates,
polysaccharides, nucleic acids, (Harrigan and Goodacre, 2003;
Dole et al., 2015), who used plasma to determine
breast cancer biomarkers, or by Villaseñor et al. ( 2007; Rossi and
Amaretti, 2010; Magnúúsdóóttir,
et al., 2015)
found that inulin-propionate ester administrated to overweight
adults signiﬁcantly reduced weight gain, intra-abdominal adipose
tissue distribution, and intrahepatocellular lipid content, and
improved insulin resistance in the inulin control group. Furthermore, other clinical studies demonstrated that the
administration of SCFAs has a positive eﬀect on the treatment
of ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease, and antibiotic-associated
diarrhea and obesity, metabolic syndrome, bowel disorders, and
cancer (Harig et al., Although thiamin diphosphate is the functional
version of thiamin, all phyla (in particular Bacteroidetes and
Fusobacteria), except Firmicutes are producers of
thiamin

Vernocchi et al. Besides, the production of niacin and pyridoxine appears to be
generated by Lactobacilli used in yogurt, cheese, and fermented
foods (Shahani and Chandan, 1979; Alm, 1982). Green leafy vegetables such as spinach, egg
yolks, and liver contain vitamin K.

Bacterial-Transformed Compounds
Bile Salts
The metabolism of bile salts is a well-known and basic skill of the
gut microbiota metabolism, particularly associated to the genera
of Bacteroides, Clostridium, Lactobacillus, Biﬁdobacterium,
Enterobacter, Eubacterium, and Escherichia (Ridlon et al., Conversely,
phenolic acid metabolites of rutin are not produced in germ-free
mice, implying that ring-ﬁssion products are generated only by
intestinal bacteria (Selma et al., Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease/Inﬂammatory
Bowel Syndrome (IBD/IBS)
As concerns inﬂammatory diseases at GI tract, it is well known
that the microbiota results to be abnormal both in IBD and
IBS, showing decreased levels of Actinobacteria and Firmicutes,
and high levels of Proteobacteria compared to healthy subjects
(Kinross et al., 2013) observed diﬀerences among patient
categories (IBD, UC, and CD) based on compounds detected in
fecal samples, such as SCFAs and their corresponding alcohols,
esters, and molecules, such as indoles and phenols, acetone and
sulfur compounds. ,2008;De
