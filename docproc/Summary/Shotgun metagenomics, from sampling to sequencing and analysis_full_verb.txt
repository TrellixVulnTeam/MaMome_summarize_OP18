Step 1: Study design and experimental protocol, the importance of this step is 
often  underestimated  in  metagenomics. We recommend associating as 
much descriptive and detailed  metadata as possible with each sample, in order to make it more likely that 
comparisons  between study  cohorts  or  sample  types  can  be  correlated with  a  particular  environmental 
variable 21.  Places genomic data within its correct phylogenetic context. Immunomagnetic

as 
diagnostics 

 By  focusing  only  on  species  of  interest,  higher sensitivity  can  be 
achieved particularly when large amounts of host contamination 
are present 

 Targeted approach - can enrich specific taxa, including those that 
might be comparatively rare members of the microbial community 
less  expensive  than  many  other  targeted  enrichment 

 Far 

techniques such as single cell genomics or flow sorting. Library preparation and sequencing 

Choosing a library preparation and sequencing method hinges on availability of materials and services, cost, 
ease  of  automation,  and  DNA  sample  quantification. Transposase-based “tagmentation”, for example in the 
Illumina Nextera and Nextera XT products, are popular owing to their low cost (list prices of $25-40 per 
sample,  with  dilution  methods  potentially  able  to  reduce  these  costs  even  further  38). The principle is that contigs from the same genome will have similar 
coverage values within each metagenome, although intra genome GC content variation, and increased read 
depth  around  bacterial  origins  of  replication,  can  challenge  this  assumption  66. Left panel: An assembly-based pipeline, which can be fully reproduced following the commands and the code 
provided as a GitHub repository at https://github.com/chrisquince/metag-rev-sup is shown on the left. Profiling of the functional classes present in a metagenome is hindered by the lack of validated annotations for most genes, an issue 
that  can  be  mitigated  only  by  expensive  and  low-throughput  gene-specific  functional  studies. The simple brute force mapping of reads to genomes 
can  result  in  profiles  with  many  false  positives  but,  nonetheless,  this  approach  has  been  proven  to  be 
effective  when  the  output  is  post-processed  based  on  lowest  common  ancestor  (LCA)  strategies  81  or 
coupled with compositional interpolated Markov models  82. By looking at co-abundant markers from pre-assembled environment specific gene catalogs 84,85, 
for example, the MetaHIT consortium was able to characterize known and novel organisms in the human 
gut 5,75. Metagenomic  assembly  is  the  preferred  theoretical 
solution if there is sufficient genome coverage (i.e. >20x), but this level of coverage is difficult to obtain for 
most  of  the  members  of  the  microbiome  (Table  4)  and  assembly-free  methods  have  other  advantages
