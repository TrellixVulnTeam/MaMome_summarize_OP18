MEGAN (Huson et al., Data Analytics and Machine Learning
Data processing is considered to be the step necessary for
converting the raw data, such as metagenomics sequence reads,
into biologically meaningful representations, such as OTU counts
using bioinformatics tools, some of which are done in the
sequencing device itself. Conclusions should
not be made based on the number of reads assigned to individual
sample features (e.g., OTUs, genes, and functional groups) since
they do not represent absolute abundances due to instrumental
limitations (Gloor et al., The third
challenge is about testing multiple hypotheses in an exploratory
analysis. (2) High dimensionality:
Metagenomic data processing results in many entities such
as genes and species discovered for each sample, which
may not be shared among multiple samples. Non-parametric tests are
good alternatives when the assumptions regarding the data
being normally distributed do not hold. ANOVA can be
generalized to multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA),
which can have multiple response variables. For
example, SparCC is used for analyzing the TwinUK dataset to
identify bacterial taxa whose abundances are inﬂuenced by host
genetics (Goodrich et al., In a diﬀerent
study, the classiﬁcation task was to identify healthy vs. unhealthy
donors given relative OTU abundance data (including species
level) coming from shotgun metagenomics sequencing of the gut
(as well as other body sites) (Pasolli et al., Multiple factor analysis (MFA)
is an extension of PCA that considers predeﬁned grouping of
features during DR to ensure equal representation for all groups

of features in derived PCs (Abdi et al., Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org

Eetemadi et al. A problem that arises in machine learning where parameter values
of a model are too closely ﬁt for training data and therefore not useful in practice. Computational Diet, Microbiome and Health

Even though there is already a considerable number of patent
applications for technologies aiming to manipulate the gut
microbiome for multiple health conditions, regulatory legislation
has not yet become speciﬁc to deal with the new scientiﬁc
advances in the ﬁeld. Interestingly, recent
research has shown that synthetic datasets can be used to
assess the performance of competing tools given a project’s
assumptions and hence provide useful benchmarks (Ounit and
Lonardi, 2016; Hitch and Creevey, 2018). We further believe that
progress in simulation-based studies can give rise to new data
processing and analytics pipelines customized for each project
based on factors such as sequencing technology, data availability,
dimensionality, and variability. Amir, A., McDonald, D., Navas-Molina, J. A., Kopylova, E., Morton, J. T., Xu, Z. Z.,
