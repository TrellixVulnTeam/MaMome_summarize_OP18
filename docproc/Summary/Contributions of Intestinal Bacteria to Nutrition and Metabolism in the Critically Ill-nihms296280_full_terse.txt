to identify associations between the microbiome and human health and disease [12].

SPECIFIC CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE GUT MICROBIOTA TO HUMAN

METABOLISM

A particularly compelling example of the importance of the gut microbiota to host
metabolism is provided by comparing the nutritional status of germ-free (GF) and
conventionally raised laboratory animals. In fact, several specialized epithelial
transporters have been recognized to participate specifically in the absorption of vitamins
derived from gut bacteria [34]. Perhaps the relative ease in replenishing vitamin stores in
ICU patients has minimized enthusiasm for aggressive investigation of how bacterial
vitamin biosynthesis is altered in hospitalized patients. de Smet A, Kluytmans JA, Cooper BS, et al.
