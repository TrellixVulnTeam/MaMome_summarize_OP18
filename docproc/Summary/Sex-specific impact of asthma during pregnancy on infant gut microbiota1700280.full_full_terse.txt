Introduction
Asthma is a common chronic disorder during pregnancy, affecting between 8% and 13% of pregnant
women [1];
is often a comorbid condition with food and environmental allergies [2]. Asthma
exacerbation rates during pregnancy are high [3], and more severe asthma or poor symptom control have
been associated with low birthweight [4–7]. A greater risk for childhood asthma following uncontrolled
versus controlled maternal asthma during pregnancy has been reported [8]. These variations in risk to the
offspring point to a potential in utero influence of maternal asthma. Using the adjusted rank transform (ART) nonparametric test
for interaction [29], the p-value for the interaction between infant sex and maternal prenatal asthma on
Lactobacillus abundance was 0.001. Discussion
In a birth cohort study of 1021 full-term Canadian infants, we detected alterations to gut microbial
composition at 3–4 months following pregnancy complicated with asthma versus pregnancy without
asthma. While no prior evidence exists for maternal prenatal asthma,
these findings are compatible with the reduced Lactobacillales abundance observed in the meconium of
newborns of mothers with eczema, and lower faecal colonisation with Lactobacillus species in infants of
atopic parents [14, 28]. In our study, male infants born to mothers with prenatal asthma were one-third
(aOR 0.26, 95% CI: 0.07–0.89) as likely to be colonised with high levels of lactobacilli, independent of
maternal overweight or atopy status, birth mode or infant diet. Ann Allergy Asthma
