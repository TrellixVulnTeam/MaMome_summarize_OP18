Data processing is considered to be the step necessary for
converting the raw data, such as metagenomics sequence reads,
into biologically meaningful representations, such as OTU counts
using bioinformatics tools, some of which are done in the
sequencing device itself. Conclusions should
not be made based on the number of reads assigned to individual
sample features (e.g., OTUs, genes, and functional groups) since
they do not represent absolute abundances due to instrumental
limitations (Gloor et al., Although several pipelines provide this functionality,
it has been found inadmissible for metagenomics microbiome
studies as it discards many reads leading to decreased sensitivity
in diﬀerential abundance testing (McMurdie and Holmes, 2014)
and biased estimates for alpha diversity (Willis, 2019). In a diﬀerent
study, the classiﬁcation task was to identify healthy vs. unhealthy
donors given relative OTU abundance data (including species
level) coming from shotgun metagenomics sequencing of the gut
(as well as other body sites) (Pasolli et al., Conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural
equation modeling (SEM) can be used to examine the extent
to which a hypothesized model of latent features and their
relationships with observed variables are supported by the
data (Schreiber et al., 2012; Relman, 2012), unlike the human genome,
it
has considerable plasticity hence providing ample opportunities

interventions,
and dietary recommendations

the microbiome and the host homeostasis and disease,
patent applications related to gut microbiome and diet have
subsequently extended to other health conditions beyond
control. We further believe that
progress in simulation-based studies can give rise to new data
processing and analytics pipelines customized for each project
based on factors such as sequencing technology, data availability,
dimensionality, and variability. Amir, A., McDonald, D., Navas-Molina, J. A., Kopylova, E., Morton, J. T., Xu, Z. Z.,
