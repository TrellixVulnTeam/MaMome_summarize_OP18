In  2005  the  international  haplotype  map  (HapMap)  project
was  initiated  to  identify,  based  on  genome-wide  association
studies 
in  ethnically  different  populations,  single
nucleotide  polymorphisms  (SNPs)  and  their  association  with
speciﬁc  human  diseases  and  individual  phenotypic  character-
istics,  respectively    Through  GWAS  an  increasing  number  of
gene  loci  have  been  identiﬁed  that  are  associated  with  individual
(future)  phenotypic  traits,  such  as  hair  or  eye  color,  height,  body
mass  index  and  others  as  well  as  with  the  disposition  to  develop  a
speciﬁc  disease    Further,  genetic  variants  are  associated  with
the  individuals’
  response  to  drug  treatment,  e.g.,  to  lithium  
Overall,  GWAS  allow  an  increasingly  better  understanding  of
disease  pathogenesis  and  a  more  accurate  assessment  of  the
individual  risk  to  develop  a  speciﬁc  disease.  Clinically,  this  may
eventually  translate  into  clinical  advances  in  disease  prevention,
early  diagnosis  and  therapy.  It  should  be  cautioned,  however,  that
the  contribution  of  a  deﬁned  SNP  to  the  risk  assessment  for  a
given  disease  must  be  weighed  against  established  clinical
parameters  and  needs  to  be  carefully  evaluated  before  entering
clinical  practice..

Taken  together,  the  emerging  data  suggest  that  the  detailed
characterization  of  the  human  intestinal  microbiome  composition,

important  commensal  host-microbe  as  well  as  microbe-,  microbe
interactions  that  may  play  a  role  in  human  health  and  disease..

In  view  of  the  numerous  and  diverse  physiological  functions  of
the  intestinal  microbiota  in  human  health  (Table  1)  it  is  not
surprising  that  it  is  also  involved  in  gastrointestinal  as  well  as  non-
gastrointestinal  diseases,  such  as  obesity/metabolic  syndrome,  and
atherosclerosis/cardiovascular  as  well  as  neurologic/psychiatric
diseases,  making  it  one  of  the  most  dynamic  current  topics  in
biomedical  research  (Table  2).  In  the  following,  a  few  examples  will
be  discussed  in  more  detail..

the  pathogenesis  of  IBD  is  not  fully  understood    it  is  clear  that

  alterations  of  the  intestinal  microbiota  that  may  serve  as
biomarkers  for  the  prediction  of  disease  predisposition,  activity/
severity  and  responsiveness  to  therapy  .

Host  genes  with  effects  on  the  composition  of  the  intestinal
microbiota  are  the  IgA  locus  and  the  HLA  genes  as  well  as  the
defensin  genes,  the  NOD2  gene,  the  resistin-like  molecule  beta
gene,  the  apolipoprotein  I  gene,  the  MEFV  gene  and  the  myeloid
differentiation  primary  response  protein  88  gene.  The  three
components 
  environment,  host  genetics  and  the  microbial
community 
  interact  to  maintain  homeostasis  in  the  intestine  
The  disruption  of  the  stability  of  this  interaction  may  be  a  trigger
for  disease  development  .  Two  recent  publications  shed  a
new  light  on  the  pathogenesis  of  IBD  through  the  change  of  the
intestinal  microbial  composition  involving  two  different  path-
ways:  helminth  infection

2.2.1.2.  Lipocalin-2  protection  from  IBD  and  colon  cancer.  Lipocalin-
2  (Lcn2)  is  an  antimicrobial  peptide  with  high  mucosal  and  fecal
concentrations  in  patients  with  IBD.  It  is  produced  by  various  cell
types,  including  epithelial  cells,  and  acts  as  an  antimicrobial
defense  mediator  by  binding  to  a  subset  of  bacterial  siderophores,
thereby  preventing  bacterial 
iron  acquisition  and  growth  of.

contributing  to  IBD  development  remained  unclear..

To  decipher  the  role  of  Lcn2  in  colon  inﬂammation,  mice  double
deﬁcient  in  Lcn2  and  IL-10  (Lcn2(cid:1)/(cid:1)/IL10(cid:1)/(cid:1) double  knockout)
were  generated  and  compared  to  single  knockouts  and  wild-type
animals.  The  experimental  data  indicate  that  Lcn2  expression
protects  from  early  onset  colitis  and  the  spontaneous  emergence  of
right-sided  colonic  tumors  that  result  from  IL-10  deﬁciency.  The
inﬂammation  is  driven  by  IL-6  which  also  controls  tumorigenesis.
The  Lcn2(cid:1)/(cid:1)/IL10(cid:1)/(cid:1) double  knockout  mice  showed  major  alter-
ations  of  their  intestinal  microbial  community,  especially  with
respect  to  the  facultative  pathogenic  Alistipes  spp.  These  contribute
to  inﬂammation  and  tumorigenesis  as  shown  by  the  transmissi-
bility  of  the  phenotype  and  the  protection  by  antibiotic  therapy.
Taken  together,  the  authors  demonstrate  that  Lcn2  protects  against
intestinal  inﬂammation  and  tumorigenesis  in  the  face  of  an  altered
intestinal  microbial  composition  .

While  donor  feces  have  previously  been  shown  to  be  effective
for  the  treatment  of  Clostridium  difﬁcile  infection   recent
randomized  controlled  trials  demonstrated  that  fecal  microbiota
transplantation  can  also  induce  clinical  remission  and  endoscopic
improvement

conventional  medical  therapy  and

Recently,  it  was  discovered  that  the  probiotic  Lactobacillus  casei

Recent  studies  suggest  that  intestinal  microbes  are  involved
in  atherosclerosis.

phosphatidylcholine  and  carnitine  such  as  meat,  egg  yolk  and
high-fat  dairy  products,  serve  as  precursors  of  trimethylamine

in  studies  of  animal
model,  employing  dietary  choline  or  TMAO,  germ-free  mice  and
microbial  transplantation,  collectively  conﬁrming  the  key  role  of
intestinal  microbiota    Taken  together,  these  results  reveal  a
link  between  speciﬁc  dietary  nutrients,
previously  unknown 
intestinal  microbes  and  thrombosis  risk  ..

The  intestinal  TMAO  formation  is  a  two-step  process  involving
the  generation  of  TMA  by  intestinal  microbes  after  food  ingestion
ﬂavin
and  the  hepatic  conversion  of  TMA  to  TMAO  by  host 
monooxygenases.  In  a  recent,  study  Wang  et  al.   demonstrated
that  3,3-dimethyl-1-butanol  (DMB),  a  structural  analog  of  choline,
blocks  the  intestinal  TMA  formation  through  the  inhibition  of  the
microbial  TMA  lyase,  and  results  in  reduced  TMAO  levels.  Thus,
‘drugging  the  microbiome’
  with  DMB  may  be  a  novel  approach  for
the  prevention/treatment  of  atherosclerosis  ..

2.2.4.  Neurodevelopmental,  psychiatric  and  neurodegenerative
diseases.

Studies  investigating  the  intestinal  microbial-brain  communica-
tion  (gut-brain  axis)  demonstrate  a  critical  role  of  the  intestinal
microbial  community  in  modulating  the  maturation  and  function  of
tissue-resident  immune  cells  in  the  central  nervous  system  (CNS)  as
well  as  the  activation  of  peripheral  immune  cells  involved  in
neuroinﬂammation,  brain  injury,  autoimmunity  and  neurogenesis
  Germ-free  mice  raised  under  sterile  conditions  or  mice
depleted  of  their  intestinal  microbiota  by  antibiotics  show  major
alterations  in  behaviours  or  neuropathologies  that  characterize
neurodevelopmental,  psychiatric  and  neurodegenerative  disorders
  These  include  among  others  autism  spectrum  disorders,
depression  and  Alzheimer’s  or  Parkinson’s  disease  (Table  2)..

An  impressive  example  for  a  pathogenic  role  of  the  intestinal
microbial  community  is  Parkinson’s  disease  (PD).  In  patients  with
PD,  plaques  in  brain  cells  as  well  as  in  the  intestine  containing  the
neurotoxic  protein  alpha-synuclein  (AS)  are  a  hallmark  of  the
disease.  For  example,  in  PD  patients  gastric  motility  is  frequently
impaired  .

In  an  animal  model,  mice  overexpressing  AS  indeed  develop
neurologic  deﬁcits  resembling  those  of  patients  with  PD.  Recently,
three  lines  of  evidence  demonstrated  a  central  role  of  the  intestinal
microbial  community  in  the  pathogenesis  of  PD:   in  the  PD
mouse  model  germ-free  animals  developed  fewer  plaques  and
almost  no  neurological  deﬁcits  as  compared  to  conventionally
colonized  controls,   treatment  of  PD  mice  with  antibiotics
resulted  in  an  improvement  of  the  neurological  deﬁcits  and  
fecal  transplantation  from  patients  with  PD  to  germ-free  mice
resulted  in  neurological  deﬁcits  resembling  PD  .

3.  Conclusions  and  perspectives.

Basic  biomedical  research  has  made  major  advances  in  recent
years  and  holds  the  promise  to  increasingly  provide  individual
diagnostic,  preventive  as  well  as  therapeutic  options  for  patients
with  inherited  or  acquired,  malignant  or  non-malignant  diseases.
Apart  from  an  increasing  number  of  host  genetic  susceptibility  loci
and  environmental  factors,  the  individual  microbial  community  is
central  for  the  barrier  between  microbes  and  hosts.  In  particular,
the  intestinal  microbial  community  is  involved  in  a  large  number
of  normal  biological  functions  in  health  (Table  1)  as  well  as  in
numerous  common,  gastrointestinal  and  non-gastrointestinal
diseases,  such  as  obesity/metabolic  syndrome,  atherosclerosis/
thrombosis  or  neurodevelopmental,  psychiatric  and  neurodegen-
erative  diseases  (Table  2).  Dietary  interventions  targeting  intesti-
ﬁber  and
nal  microbiota,  such  as  calory  restricted  diets  rich  in 
vegetables  as  well  as  fecal  microbial  transplantation  are  examples
for  health  beneﬁts  in  humans.  In  recent  years,  the  intestinal
microbiome  thus  has  become  one  of  the  most  dynamic  areas  of
biomedical  research 
for
interventions  regarding  human  health  and  disease..

that  holds  an  enormous  potential .

In  addition  to  the  intestinal  microbiome,  other  sites  of  the
human  microbiome  are  of  increasing  interest.  In  particular,  the
skin  microbiome  has  been  shown  to  be  highly  personalized  with  a
high  degree  of  interindividual  variability.  Thus,  the  HMP  yielded
ﬁelds  of  microbiology  and
not  only  important  contributions  to  the 
medicine,  but  also  unexpected  and  novel  applications  to  other
ﬁelds  and  disciplines,  such  as  as  forensic  medicine  .
