increasing body of evidence suggests that estrogens
also have important beneficial effects on body fat and
metabolism in males .

The gut microbiota comprises trillions of bacteria that
contribute to nutrient acquisition and energy regulation
 Growing evidence indicates that obesity is
closely linked with low-grade chronic inflammation
(LGCI), which can lead to MS  In addition,
changes in the composition of the gut microbiota are
known to be associated with the development of obesity
and its associated metabolic disorders  Interestingly,
an increased ratio of the major phyla Firmicutes and
Bacteroidetes (FIR/BAC ratio) and depletion of several
bacterial species (e.g., Akkermansia mucinophilia) can
promote the development of obesity in both dietary and
genetic models of obesity in mice  Other studies
in animal models of obesity suggest that obesity-induced
gut dysbiosis caused by either environmental or genetic
factors increase populations of bacteria that produce the
endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and decrease
LPS-suppressing bacteria  This process leads to
impaired gut barrier integrity and release of LPS from
intestinal gram-negative bacteria into the bloodstream
which in turn leads to Toll-like receptor 4
(TLR4)-mediated metabolic endotoxemia (ME), LGCI and
insulin resistance in obese mice  Moreover,
chronic injection of LPS in mice causes mild obesity and
insulin resistance  highlighting a possible role for
microbiota-derived LPS in obesity-induced inflammation.
The causative role of the gut microbiota in the context
of MS is well characterized  but the role of
sexual
gut
microbiota in the context of MS, and the associated
mechanisms underlying such differences, are still un-
clear. Here, we report that sexual dimorphism in MS is
associated with estrogen-mediated changes in the gut
microbiome, ME and LGCI, and that 17β-estradiol.

Results
Sex differences in ME and LGCI are associated with sexual
dimorphism in MS
We found that relative to males (n = 11), female mice (n =
11) had significantly lower levels of markers of WD-induced
obesity, including gross appearance of mice, intra-abdominal.

and gonadal fat distribution, body weight gain, and white
adipose tissues accumulation) (Additional
file 1: Figure
S1a-c). Noticeably, although there were no differences in
energy intake between males and females (Additional file 1:
Figure S1d), relative to males, females had improved MS pa-
rameters such as glucose intolerance (glucose tolerance test
with area under the curve and HOMA-IR) (Additional file 1:
Figure S1e), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (Additional file 1:
Figure S1F-I), and dyslipidemia (total serum cholesterol,
triglyceride, HDL-C, LDL-C, and atherogenic index) (Add-
itional file 1: Figure S1j-n). We then investigated whether
oral 17β-E (E2) administration ameliorated WD-induced
MS in male and ovariectomized (OVX) mice (n = 5 per
group). Interestingly, MS parameters were more evident in
OVX mice compared to normal female (F) mice, and the
administration of 17β-E significantly suppressed the devel-
opment of MS in the male (male+E2) and OVX (OVX+E2)
groups (Fig 1a–o and Additional
file 1: Figure S1y-z),
irrespective of energy intake (Additional file 1: Figure S1x).
Notably, there were no significant differences in MS param-
eters between the female and male+E2 groups (Fig. 1a–o
and Additional file 1: Figure S1y-z). This was accompanied
with elevated levels of serum 17β-E concentrations in male
+E2 and OVX+E2 groups treated with 17β-E compared to
control male and OVX groups respectively (Additional file 1:
Figure S1p). We investigated whether sexual dimorphism in
MS is associated with sex-specific differences in the markers
of ME [serum LPS, LPS-binding protein (LBP), soluble
CD14 (sCD14), and intestinal permeability] and LGCI
[tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α),
interleukin-1β (IL-1β),
IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and
IL-10], and whether estrogen plays a key role in this context.
Surprisingly, we found significant differences in the markers
of ME  and
LGCI  be-
tween WD-fed male and female mice. Lack of endogenous
estrogen support in the OVX mice induced significantly ele-
vated levels of markers of ME  and LGCI
 compared to the female group. Moreover, 17β-E
treatment reduced the occurrence of ME and LGCI in the
M+E2 and OVX+E2 groups to levels equal to those female
mice ..

Gut microbiome mediates the development of metabolic
syndrome in a sex-specific manner
Given that metabolic endotoxemia is commonly derived
from gut dysbiosis, we next used high-throughput 16S
rRNA gene sequencing to determine whether sexual di-
morphism exist in gut microbiome, and whether 17β-E
treatment affected the microbiome composition. V3-V4
16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed on fecal sam-
ples collected from M, F, M+E2, OVX, and OVX+E2
groups (n = 5 per group) that were fed a WD. Principal
coordinate (PCoA) analysis of a common β-diversity.

Furthermore, the relative abundance (RA) of taxa, which
showed false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected P value < 0.05
with differential expression analysis conducted on whole
microbiota profile, were expressed as heat map (Fig. 2d and
Additional file 1: Table S2), including hierarchical clustering
(HCN). HCN is a clustering technique for graphically sum-
marizing the inter-sample relationships in the form of a
dendrogram. HCN also clearly separated the male/OVX
samples as a single cluster from the other three groups (F,
M+E2, OVX+E2) (Additional file 1: Figure S2a). In order to
further identify microbial taxa that serve as biomarkers for
different groups, we performed liner discriminate analysis
(LDA) coupled with effect size measurements (LEfSe). A
cladogram  generated from LEfSe analysis showed
the relationship between taxon and biomarker taxa (LDA
score > 2 and a significance of P < 0.05 determined by the
Wilcoxon signed-rank test) (Additional file 1: Figure S2b).
Notably,
the
LPS-producing phylum Proteobacteria and its members
(class_γ-Proteobacteria, family_Enterobacteriacea and gen-
us_Escherichia/Shigella) were higher in the OVX group
(Additional file 1: Figure S2b). We also demonstrated that a
number of well-studied microbiota-based markers of obes-
ity and MS associated with LGCI were affected by estrogen.
These included the phylum Proteobacteria  Firmicutes
to Bacteroidetes ratio (FIR/BAC ratio—a known marker of
obesity  Bifidobacterium/Enterobacteriaceae ratio
(B/E)—a well-established marker of colonization resistance
to opportunistic pathogens  and the genus Akkerman-
sia, which has been shown to reduce fat mass gain and
WAT macrophage infiltration and improve gut barrier
function and glucose metabolism  Sexual dimorphism
was clearly identified with respect to all four markers, with
significantly lower Proteobacteria abundance, decreased
FIR/BAC ratios, higher B/E ratios, and increased Akker-
mansia abundance in normal females compared to normal
male and OVX females . 17β-E treatment signifi-
cantly reduced Proteobacteria and elevated Akkermansia in
the male (M+E2)  and significantly reduced the
Proteobacteria and increased the B/E ratio in OVX fe-
males (OVX+E2) . In addition, resulting taxa
identified with pairwise comparison analyses at different
taxonomic levels are summarized in the Additional file 1:
Table S3. Next, we employed PICRUSt to predict the
metagenomes and determine the changes in microbial
metabolic pathways (KEGG) across different groups 
Male/OVX groups were segregated from the other three
groups using PCoA applied on predicted functional path-
ways (Additional file 1: Figure S2c). According to LEfSe
analysis, LPS-related functional pathways were signifi-
cantly lower in the female, M+E2 and OVX+E2 groups
compared to male and OVX groups (Additional file 1: Fig-
ure S2d-f). The α-diversity profile for groups reached.

We next used fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)
and antibiotic (ABX)-induced depletion to investigate
whether gut microbiota were necessary to mediate sex-
ual dimorphism in MS. FMT with fecal content from

and elevated serum TG , and markers of ME
 in female recipients, with
no differences between male and M → F groups (n = 5
per group). Moreover, fecal β-diversity microbiota ana-
lysis 
showed that the M and M → F samples were clustered
together and were separated from the female control
group (n = 3 per group). M and M → F groups presented
with higher Proteobacteria and Firmicutes and lower
Verrucomicrobia and Bacteroidetes compared to females
. LEfSe showed γ-Proteobacteria and Enterobac-
teriacea for M and M → F groups analyzed as a single
cluster (Fig. 3m and Additional
file 1: Figure S3g).
Higher RA of both Proteobacteria and FIR/BAC ratios,
and lower B/E ratio and Akkermansia muciniphila abun-
dance (Additional file 1: Figure S2g-j) were also observed
with the M → F group, while there were no significant
differences in the α-diversity measures (Additional file 1:
Figure S3h-l). Principal component analysis (PCA) with
predicted metabolic pathways clustered the M and M →
F groups (Additional file 1: Figure S2k), and significantly
higher abundance of LPS-related functions were found
with LEfSe analysis (Additional file 1: Figure S2l). Finally,
all of the abovementioned results were associated with
undetectable (< 6.6 pg/mL) serum E2 levels in the M →
F(Additional file 1: Figure S3m) group after FMT..

To further explore the causative role of gut micro-
biota, we next depleted the gut microbiota in mice
using a well-established ABX cocktail. Male and female
mice (n = 5/group) were fed WD for 10 weeks to induce
MS. As expected, we found appreciable sexual dimorph-
ism in the markers of ME , LGCI (Fig. 4b and
Additional
file 1: Figure S4a), and MS (Fig. 4c and
Additional file 1: Figure S4b-d). Mice then received the
ABX cocktail in drinking water for next 6 weeks. Strik-
ingly, in addition to elimination of sexual dimorphism in
markers of ME , LGCI
(Fig. 4e–h and
Additional file 1: Figure S4a), and MS (Fig. 4i–n and
Additional file 1: Figure S4b-d), female mice showed
significantly elevated levels of gut permeability ,.

Isoflavones produce microbiome modifying effects similar
to estrogen and reverse MS in male mice
To explore whether estrogen-like compounds can produce
similar effects to those we found in the 17β-E-treated male,
we used isoflavones (ISO) such as genistein (G) and daid-
zein (D). Male mice (n = 10) were fed WD for 4 months to
induce severe obesity and MS and then treated with or
without G and D isoflavones for 5 weeks. Interestingly, ISO.

treatment significantly reversed the WD-induced obesity
,
dyslipidemia , and NAFLD (including formation
of Mallory bodies and mild fibrosis induced by WD)
 despite similar energy intake between the male
(n = 4) and male+ISO (n = 6) groups (Additional file 1:
Figure S5a). As expected, the reversal of MS parameters
was associated with lower levels of markers of ME .

and LGCI
. Furthermore, we found higher
mRNA levels of estrogen receptor (ER)-α and no changes
with ER-β in the duodenal tissues of ISO-treated male
mice (Additional file 1: Figure S5b-c). Moreover, principal
coordinate β-diversity analysis applied on entire fecal
microbiome population distinctly clustered the Male+ISO
and Male samples on axis one . Interestingly, simi-
lar to 17β-E, SIMPER test showed a higher contribution of
Escherichia-Shigella to the M group whereas Akkermansia,
Bifidobacterium, and Bacteroides were associated with the
M+ISO group . At the phylum level, ISO treatment
significantly reduced the RA of Proteobacteria and in-
creased Actinobacteria and Verrucomicrobia . Dif-
ferential expression with HCN analysis also grouped the M
+ISO samples and the RA of major bacterial groups as
shown in the heat map . In addition, significantly
lower Proteobacteria levels , higher B/E ratios
, and signifi-
cantly greater α-diversity measures (Additional file 1: Figure
S5b-f) were observed in the M+ISO group, although no dif-
ferences were observed with FIR/BAC ratios . PCA
of predicted functional metabolic pathways also segregated
the M+ISO group from the male samples . In
addition, the RA of LPS-related functional pathways were
significantly lower in M+ISO group compared to male
group , which was also confirmed by LEfSe
analysis . These data suggest that dietary supple-
mentation of phytoestrogens such as ISO may exert effects
similar to those of 17β-E on the microbiome, ME, and
LGCI in males to prevent MS..

Intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) drives sexual
dimorphism in gut microbiota
It has been well established that endogenous antimicro-
bial peptides (eAMP) (e.g., IAP and Reg3γ) maintain
normal gut homeostasis and regulate gut microbiota
composition  Next, we examined the extent to.

which sexual dimorphism in gut microbiome was driven
by differences in AMP levels between males and females,
and whether estrogen status affected endogenous eAMP
production. Among the eAMPs analyzed (Fig. 6a, b and
Additional file 1: Figure S5i-j), we found significant dif-
ferences only in IAP between groups based on sex and
estrogen treatment . Recently, we and others
have shown the gut microbiome-modifying effects of in-
testinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP), especially with re-
spect to LPS-related and gram-positive bacterial groups
 In addition to in vitro cell culture studies,
the study groups  were
duodenal
analyzed for IAP after 6 weeks of 17β-E treatment. We
found upregulated mRNA expression levels of Akp3 (a
major IAP isozyme) , downregulated expression
of the Akp6 IAP isozyme , higher villus-associ-
ated enterocytes expression of IAP with immunohisto-
chemical staining , elevated IAP protein levels
, and elevated IAP enzymatic activity in the duo-
denum  of female and 17β-E-treated male and
OVX groups compared to normal male and OVX mice.
Moreover, the stimulation of differentiated Caco2 cells
with 17β-E significantly elevated IAP levels in a
time-dependent manner . Similarly, elevated
mRNA expression of Akp3 (Fig. 6g, with no detection of
expression of Akp6), higher immunochemical staining of
IAP , and
elevated IAP activity  were observed in the duo-
denum of M+ISO group compared to male group after
5 weeks of ISO treatment. In addition, in vitro stimula-
tion of Caco2 cells with 25 μM concentration of either
genistein (G) or daidzein (D) or G+D combination also
resulted in increased IAP protein levels . We also
examined
using
of
L-phenylalanine (L-phe), a specific non-competitive in-
hibitor of IAP. L-phe pretreat-
ment of Caco2 cells blocked the elevation of IAP protein.

found with 17β-E and ISO treatment . Further
analysis using samples collected from in vivo (17β-E and
ISO experiments in mice) and in vitro (Caco-2 cells) ex-
periments indicated that both 17β-E and ISO signifi-
cantly upregulated the mRNA levels of nuclear
transcription factor KLF4 (gut-enriched Krüppel-like fac-
tor) (Additional file 1: Figure S5k-l). There was a clear
trend of increased mRNA levels of Cdx1 (caudal-type
homeobox-1)

scription factors that target IAP  To further ver-
ify whether
factors
responsible for the differences in the gut microbiota
between male and female C57BL/6 mice, we exam-
ined the effects of IAP inhibition on the status of key
microbiota changes. After 8 weeks of WD and L-phe
treatment, we found that the L-phe-treated female
mice exhibited a significant increase in LPS-producing Pro-
teobacteria, decrease of B/E ratio, increase of the relative
abundance (RA) of Akkermansia muciniphila and no
differences in FIR/BAC ratio  compared to the
untreated female (F) group (n = 5 per group). Accordingly,
the L-phe-treated female group showed significantly
higher
levels of markers of metabolic endotoxemia
, and glucose intolerance (Fig. 6v
with no differences in body weight gain . These
results support the notion that sexual dimorphism in en-
dogenous IAP activity might partially drive differences in
gut microbiota between male and female, and 17β-E and
ISO-treated C57BL/6 mice..

relationships might change when additional variables are
taken into account  The HMI network  was
first built from Spearman’s nonparametric rank correlation
coefficient (P < 0.05) between host parameters and micro-
bial genera. Each node was colored according to the “data
type” and sized based on “betweenness centrality,” which
quantifies the influence of a node in connecting other
nodes within network values. Edges (lines) represent sta-
tistically significant correlations, and are colored light
black for positive and blue for negative correlations. Next,
nodes were grouped as modules and the first three largest
modules of the network were taken to show the relation-
ship between specific genera and host parameters (Fig. 7b,
d). Partial least square (PLS) regression loading score plot
 illustrates the association of between host param-
eters (dependent variables colored blue) and microbial
genera (explanatory variables colored red). Samples from
five different groups were observations (green dots). Ac-
cordingly, a diagram illustrating a proposed mechanism
has been developed . Endogenous estrogens in
the female mice, exogenous supplementation of 17β-E
to male and ovariectomized female mice, and dietary
supplementation of ISO to male mice upregulate KLF4
transcription factor that target IAP, which, in turn, in-
creases the endogenous IAP activity in the gut. Ele-
vated IAP activity leads to decrease Proteobacteria and
FIR/BAC, increase B/E, and the abundance of Akker-
mansia genera, decreasing LPS-producing bacteria
(e.g., Proteobacteria) while increasing LPS-suppressing
bacteria (e.g., Bifidobacterium and Akkermansia muci-
nophila). These changes lower LPS production and IP,
resulting in reduced ME. The subsequent reduction of
inflammatory cytokines leads to the suppression of

Fig. 7 Network interactions reveal host-microbiome interactions (HMI) driven by estrogen status. a–d The HMI network (a) was first built from
Spearman’s nonparametric rank correlation coefficient (P < 0.05) between host parameters and microbial genera. Each node was colored according to
the “data type” and sized based on “betweenness centrality,” which quantifies the influence of a node in connecting other nodes within network
values. Edges (lines) represent statistically significant correlations and are colored light black for positive and blue for negative correlations. Next, nodes
were grouped as modules (a set nodes connected to each other by many links, while connected by few links to nodes of other groups) and the first
three largest modules of the network were taken to show the relationship between specific genera and host parameters (b-d). e Partial least square

upregulate nuclear transcription factors (KLF4) that target IAP, which, in turn, increases the endogenous IAP activity in the gut. Elevated IAP activity
leads to decreased Proteobacteria and Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio (FIR/BAC), increased Bifidobacterium to Enterobacteriacea ratio (B/E), and the
abundance of Akkermansia genera, decreasing LPS-producing bacteria (e.g., Proteobacteria) while increasing LPS-suppressing bacteria (e.g., Bifidobacterium
and Akkermansia mucinophila). These changes lower LPS production (LPS biosynthesis and related proteins) and intestinal permeability, resulting in
reduced metabolic endotoxemia (serum LPS/LPS binding proteins/soluble CD14). The subsequent reduction of inflammatory cytokines leads to the
suppression of low-grade chronic inflammation and metabolic syndrome. AI, atherogenic index; TG, triglyceride; IAP, intestinal alkaline phosphatase;

effects on the gut microbiome mediate sexual dimorphism
in MS in C57BL/6 mice and sex-specific expression and
activity of IAP, a major gut microbiota-modifying factor
 Given the causative role of ME originating from
dysbiotic gut microbiota and LGCI induced by ME in the
context of WD-induced obesity and MS  the
novel findings in our study are as follows: sex-specific
differences in the gut microbiota composition (e.g., Proteo-
bacteria, FIR/BAC ratio, B/E ratio, and Akkermansia) and
functions (e.g., LPS biosynthesis and LPS-related proteins)
and markers of ME and LGCI induced by WD are associ-
ated with sexual dimorphism in MS. Male mice are
markedly susceptible to ME and LGCI and female mice
are exclusively protected from ME and LGCI. Gut
microbiota, especially LPS-related bacteria, mediate the
sexual dimorphism in MS, reflected by the fact that male
mice microbiota transplants induced ME, LGCI, and MS
in the female recipients and that ABX abolished the sexual
dimorphism and worsened the MS markers in female
mice. 17β-E induces gut microbiome changes, which is
associated with lower susceptibility to WD-induced ME,
LGCI, and MS in the male and OVX mice. Moreover,
17β-E-induced gut microbiome changes and protection
against MS are associated with elevation of activity and
expression of IAP. Estrogen-like compounds (e.g., iso-
flavones) had gut microbiome-modifying effects similar to
estrogens and prevented WD-induced ME, LGCI, and MS
in male mice by elevating IAP, indicating that dietary sup-
plementation of isoflavones could be a potential alterna-
tive to 17β-E to treat men and postmenopausal women
who are affected by obesity and MS. IAP could largely
mediate the 17β-E and ISO-induced gut microbiome
changes, and this might be due to the E2-mediated upreg-
ulation of transcription factors that target IAP such as
KLF4 and CDX1..

It is important to note that the major gut micro-
biota findings (changes in Proteobacteria, FIR/BAC ra-
and Akkermansia)

reported here
regarding sexual dimorphism have been studied ex-
tensively in animals and also in the humans in the

from animal models identified consistent differences
in the two major bacterial phyla, with a significant in-
crease in Firmicutes and decrease in Bacteroidetes

wild-type mice despite similarities in their diet and
activity levels  Consistent with pre-clinical data,
numerous human studies have consistently demon-
strated that the FIR/BAC ratio is specifically increased

rived from gut dysbiosis is central to the pathogenesis
of chronic low-grade inflammation, a factor underlying

affecting LPS production and gut barrier function. It is
therefore conceivable that the 17β-E-induced marked re-
ductions in LPS-producing bacteria (e.g., Proteobacteria)
and increases in LPS-suppressing bacteria (e.g., Bifidobac-
terium and A. mucinophila) significantly sup-
pressed
and
inflammation. Recent clinical studies have shown that
LPS-producing bacteria are abundant in obese subjects
with type 2 diabetes  It has also been
shown that male mice fed a WD rich in milk fat and
of
omega-6
of
LPS-producing
LPS-suppressing Bifidobacterium spp 
Along these lines, the WD diet used in the present
study induced a dramatic increase in Proteobacteria and a
decrease in Bifidobacterium in male and OVX mice (Fig. 3
and 5). In this context, decreasing the abundance of LPS-
producing bacteria and increasing the LPS-suppressing
bacteria may be a key mechanism for the reduction of
metabolic endotoxemia. Another potential mechanism
contributing to the reduction of serum LPS may be a de-
crease in gut permeability, due to the observed elevation
of gut barrier-protecting bacteria such as Bifidobacterium
by estrogen in our study..

In postmenopausal women and in female animal
models,
lower estrogen levels are associated with in-
creased visceral adiposity and estrogen replacement
improves glucose-insulin homeostasis  We have
shown here for the first time the effects of E2 replace-
ment on gut microbiota and metabolic endotoxemia in
OVX mice, which mimics the postmenopausal state.
There is growing evidence for a fundamental role of es-
trogen in the regulation of obesity and related metabolic
disorders in males  and recent data from rodent
studies suggest that hepatic estrogen signaling has a key
role in the prevention of high-fat diet-induced insulin
resistance in males. However, it is not known whether
estrogen treatment in males protects MS by modulating
gut microbiota. Our novel results show that estrogen
treatment in males is associated with the modulation of
gut microbiota and improvement
in ME and LGCI,
which is associated with improvements in weight man-
agement and obesity-induced metabolic changes ,
supporting the concept that estrogen plays an important
role in the control of serum LPS levels by affecting
LPS-related gut microbiota..

IAP is an endogenous antimicrobial peptide with nu-
is highly
merous physiological
expressed in the small
intestine, secreted from apical
enterocytes into the lumen in microvilli vesicles, and
travels to the large intestine  IAP is known to inhibit
the growth of E. coli and gram-negative bacteria by de-
phosphorylating LPS located in the outer membrane [32,
48–51]. IAP is also able to dephosphorylate ATP .

Kaliannan et al. Microbiome           6:205 .

which has been shown to reduce the survival of
gram-positive bacteria  and to support the growth
of gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli  Oral IAP
supplementation has also been shown to prevent E. coli
overgrowth  We recently found in our fat-1 mice
model (transgenic mice with elevated tissue n-6/n-3 fatty
acid ratio) that elevated endogenous IAP activity and ex-
pression is associated with lower levels of LPS-producing
bacteria and higher levels of LPS-suppressing bacteria
 Moreover, we found that inhibition of IAP by phenyl-
alanine, a frequently used specific inhibitor of endogenous
IAP activity  caused ME, LGCI, and MS by
increasing the growth of LPS-producing Proteobacteria
and reducing the growth of LPS-suppressing Bifidobacter-
ium spp in a mouse model of elevated endogenous IAP
activity  It is clear that IAP expression in the intes-
tine is a critical determinant of the gut microbiota profile.
Our findings indicate that IAP may be a primary factor
partially mediating the effects of estrogen on gut micro-
biota because IAP inhibition in the female mice led to the
development of ME, LGCI, and MS, associated with dra-
matic increase of Proteobacteria and reduction of the B/E
ratio and A. mucinophila abundance . The
mechanism by which estrogen may modulate IAP ex-
pression is possibly due to its regulatory effect on the
KLF4 transcription factor, which has been shown to
target IAP .

Isoflavones (ISO) are non-steroidal compounds that
can bind to both ER-α and ER-β due to their ability to
mimic the conformational structure of estradiol [54,
55], and thereby imitate the actions of estrogens on
target tissues  Isoflavones are found in many le-
gumes and are particularly abundant in soy products.
Genistein (G) and daidzein (D), two major soy isofla-
vone glucosides, are present at high concentrations in
soybeans and soybean-derived products and are a
source of xenoestrogen exposure in both
major
humans (e.g., soy-based formula for infants, tofu) and
animals (most commercially available diets). G and D
are widely used as dietary supplements in the USA for
various presumed health benefits  Ferguson et al.

Meals high in fat, or fat and simple carbohydrates, are

mation, and hypothesized to be linked to transient

hypertriglyceridemia, and hepatic status in animal
studies. Isoflavones have been shown to improve intes-
tinal barrier integrity and reduce colitis in animal
models potentially through modulation of the gut
microbiome  ISO may therefore confer protection
against diet-induced metabolic dysfunction and reduce
insulin resistance in males and

proposal that ISO could be an effective alternative to
E2 treatment..

Although we claim to explain the metabolic sexual di-
morphism by effects of E2 through gut microbiota, we
acknowledge that many other studies in the field showed
that the major impact of estrogens on the metabolism
are through estrogen receptor expression in metabolic
tissues  Clinical trials revealed that hormone re-
placement therapy (HRT) in postmenopausal women re-
duced the features of MS and inflammation 
Conversely, findings from Women’s Health Initiative clin-
ical trials (WHI-CT) did not support use of HRT for
chronic disease prevention  However, the WHI-CT
results were based on a group of women who were much
older than those normally treated with HRT and who had
other numerous risk factors  Noticeably, there were
very limited surveys performed addressing the effects on
the metabolic syndrome components in postmenopausal
women  Early treatment with low-dosage HRT in
healthy perimenopausal women was found to have benefi-
cial effects on the components of metabolic syndrome and
could decrease the risk of cardiovascular events since
the absolute risk of CVD events were markedly lower in
younger, compared to older, women .

Although our results from FMT  and antibiotics
 experiments contradict the protective effect of en-
dogenous estrogen against obesity in female mice, it is
well known that antibiotic usage 
impacts estrogen metabolism mediated by microbiota
Consequently, changes in circulating levels of estrogen
(Additional file 1 Figure S3m and Additional file 1:
Figure S4e) were found in female mice that received
male microbiota transplants or antibiotic treatment.
We hypothesize that estrogen-mediated gut micro-
biome changes may be the cause for sex differences in
obesity and MS in this study. It is important to note
the estrogen-mediated sex differences and the role of
the microbiome have been linked in other disease con-
ditions (e.g., autoimmunity)  The bacterial changes
reported here are similar to previous studies where ovari-
ectomy or estrogen supplementation was performed. A
study with OVX animals showed elevated Firmicutes to
Bacteroidetes ratio com-
pared to normal females. Likewise, it was shown that E2
supplementation elevated the relative abundance of Akker-
mansia and Bifidobacterium in the male and OVX mice.

Kaliannan et al. Microbiome           6:205 .

respectively  Estrogen inhibited the overgrowth of
Proteobacteria and E. coli and decreased the levels of LBS
and LBP under simulated microgravity  In addition,
E2 supplementation in male pre-
vented obesity and MS, and genistein prevented obesity
and metabolic dysfunction in the mice, which was similar
to E2 supplementation in the same study .

Conclusions
Our novel data demonstrate that the gut microbiome
mediates sexual dimorphism in MS. Overall measures
of correlation, pairwise correlations, and multivariate
correlation analyses between the microbiota and host pa-
rameters that we performed provided novel insight into
the host–microbiota system in the context of sexual di-
morphism in WD-induced MS. Estrogen or estrogen-like
compounds induced elevated IAP levels likely by upregu-
lating the function of the KLF4 transcription factor that
targets IAP and subsequent gut microbiome changes

tion)  compounds with estrogen-like activity (e.g., iso-
flavones and 17α-estradiol
 and non-feminizing
effects may represent an alternative approach to the man-
agement of obesity and MS in males. Understanding the
molecular basis of estrogen-mediated changes in IAP ac-
tivity and gut microbiome may provide new approaches to
the management of obesity-associated metabolic disease
in men and menopausal women with estrogen deficiency,
a condition that can last approximately 30 years of a
woman’s life .

Animal experiments
Body weight and food intake were measured every week
for all mice. All food was replaced weekly to avoid con-
tamination. For collection of blood samples, mice were
fasted for 6 h during the light phase period and blood
was taken from the facial vein unless otherwise speci-
fied. After 6 h fasting, animals used in this study were
euthanized by i.p. injection of pentobarbital (200 mg/
kg). Several experiments with special treatments are de-
scribed below..

endotoxemia, low-grade chronic inflammation, and
metabolic syndrome: Male (M) WT (n = 11) and
female (F) (n = 11) mice were weaned and switched
to western diet (WD) until the age of 20 weeks to
induce severe WD-induced obesity and MS. Both
groups were subjected to analysis of markers of
metabolic endotoxemia (ME) (including LPS, LBP,
sCD14, and intestinal permeability), systemic low-
grade chronic inflammation (LGCI) (including
TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, MCP-1, and IL-10), and meta-
bolic syndrome (MS) (including weight gain, glu-
cose tolerance test with area under the curve,
insulin resistance index assessed by HOMA-IR,
serum lipid profile including total cholesterol (TC),
triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein-C (LDL-
C) and high-density lipoprotein-C (HDL-C) and
atherogenic index, non-alcoholic fatty liver score
and serum aspartate transaminase (AST) and ala-
nine transaminase (ALT), and analysis of fecal
microbiota by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and
serum LPS levels by LAL assay. The mice were then
euthanized and white adipose tissue (WAT), which
includes visceral (vWAT), subcutaneous (sWAT),
and epididymal (eWAT) fat pads, and liver weights
were taken. A portion of the liver was stored in 10%
formalin for histological analysis. Tissues were snap
frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at − 80 °C
for future analyses..

2) Determination of 17β-estradiol effects on gut micro-
biome, metabolic endotoxemia, low-grade chronic
inflammation, and metabolic syndrome: Ten-week-
old male (M), female (F), and ovariectomized
(OVX) mice maintained on control diet were pur-
chased from Charles River Laboratories and divided
in to five groups (n = 5/group), and were fed WD
and 17β-estradiol (E2) from week 11 to week 17.
The five groups are 
OVX, and was pre-
pared and given to groups 3 and 5 in the drinking
water as described previously  E2 was dissolved
in 95% ethanol  Solubilized E2 was
added to the drinking water to produce.

Kaliannan et al. Microbiome           6:205 .

concentration of 4000 ng E2/mL water with final
ethanol concentration of 0.1%. Groups 1, 2, and 4
received a normal drinking water bottle with 0.1%
ethanol. The water bottles were changed every week
for all the groups. After 6 weeks, mice were sub-
jected to analysis for markers of ME and systemic
LGCI and MS as mentioned in section 1. The mice
were then euthanized and WAT and liver weights
were taken. A portion of the liver and duodenum
was stored in 10% formalin for histological analysis.
Tissues were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and
then stored at − 80 °C for future analyses..

3) Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT): Mice from
each group were individually housed for receiving
antibiotic treatment to the end of the experiment.
Fecal microbiota in place of cecal microbiota was
transplanted for convenience and in order to
minimize the number of animals used as donors.
FMT with fecal content from donor male (M) mice
that were fed WD for 10 weeks was performed on
female 10-week-old mice  Before the microbial
transplantation, recipient mice (M → F) were
treated with a 200 μL antibiotic cocktail (ampicillin,
1 g/l; metronidazole, 1 g/l; vancomycin, 0.5 g/l; neo-
mycin, 0.5 g/l) (Sigma, USA) administrated by oral
gavage once a day for 3 days. During the last 8 h of
antibiotic treatment, mice were fed a WD to facili-
tate subsequent colonization. Fresh fecal pellets
from donors were immediately weighed and placed
into Ringer’s solution and then diluted to 10 mg/
mL. Immediately after diluting the fecal materials,
fecal solutions were gavaged to
4-h-fasted female recipients. Control groups of mice
(males and females) were force-fed with 200 μL of
transfer buffer alone to eliminate the effects of gav-
age per se. Two days later, these mice received an-
other gavage to exclude possibility of any
unsuccessful inoculation. We conducted this FMT
procedure once a week for the next 3 weeks. After
the first microbiota gavage, all mice were fed a WD
for 20 weeks. Measurement of body composition
(fat mass) was performed using nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) technique (minispec Body Com-
position Analyzer based on Time Domain NMR)
that provides noninvasive and rapid measurement
without anesthetics. Fecal samples from these three
groups (M/F/M → F; n = 5 per group) were col-
lected after WD feeding for 20 weeks and three
fecal samples from each group were subjected to
16S rRNA sequencing..

4) Antibiotic (ABX) treatment: 10-week-old male (n =.

5) and female (n = 5) mice maintained on chow diet
were switched to a WD until the age of 20 weeks to
induce sexual dimorphism in MS. After collecting.

serum and stool for baseline measurements, both
males and females receiving a WD started receiving
a broad spectrum antibiotic cocktail (ABX) contain-
ing ampicillin  neo-
mycin sulfate 
and metronidazole (orally gavaged
every 12 h) for 6 weeks to deplete the gut micro-
biota  Validation of successful depletion of gut
microbiota after the antibiotic treatment was per-
formed as described previously  Briefly, bacter-
ial cultivation (both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria)
of feces was performed on day 24 of the antibiotic
treatment mice as described previously  The
detection limit of the assay (successful depletion)
was defined as 1 cfu/mg feces. In addition, the bac-
terial genomic DNA was extracted from fresh stool
samples of these mice and 16S rRNA gene copies
for all bacteria (Table S4) was measured with qPCR
method as described below. Both bacterial cultiva-
tion (cfu/mg feces) and qPCR results (Ct values)
were compared with results from pre-antibiotic
treatment fecal samples to confirm a significant de-
pletion of gut microbiota. Mice with antibiotic
treatment were subjected to analysis for markers of
ME and systemic LGCI and MS as mentioned in
section 1..

5) Analysis of the effects of isoflavones (ISO) on gut
microbiome, ME, LGCI, and MS: Ten-week-old
male (M) mice were fed a WD for 4 months to in-
duce MS and then divided into two groups: group
1: M, (n = 4), and group 2: M+ISO (n = 6). ISO such
as genistein and daidzein (Cayman, USA) were sup-
plemented at 0.1% in the WD, the M group was fed
a WD, and the M+ISO group was fed a WD supple-
mented with ISO for the next 5 weeks. Mice were
then subjected to analysis for markers of ME and
systemic LGCI and MS as mentioned in section 1.
The mice were then euthanized and white adipose
tissue (WAT) and liver weights were taken. A por-
tion of the liver and duodenum was stored in 10%
formalin for histological analysis. Tissues were snap
frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at − 80 °C
for future analyses..

phosphatase (IAP) inhibition on gut microbiome,
ME, LGCI, and metabolic abnormalities: To
determine the effects of inhibiting endogenous IAP
activity, 12-week-old WT mice on a WD were di-
vided into three groups ((male (M), female (F), and
F+L-phe)) (n = 5 per group) and allowed to drink
autoclaved water alone or water containing 10 mM
L-phenylalanine (L-phe) (Sigma, USA). After
8 weeks, the serum and fecal samples were collected
to analyze the markers of ME, LGCI, and MS..

The α-diversity of each group was calculated based on.

the annotated data using the diversity indices of the PAST
version 2.17 software program  Based on a non-para-

Monte Carlo permutations  comparative analyses of
the group-specific α-diversity indices were performed. Or-
dinations are the dimensional-reduction techniques which
are commonly used to visualize complex relationships
between communities between groups (β-diversity). Di-
mensional reduction of the Bray-Curtis distance between
microbiome samples using PCoA ordination method
(PAST software) was done and significant differences
among groups were tested with permutational multivari-
ate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA), a multivariate
non-parametric one-way ANOVA, which utilizes the
sample-to-sample Bray-Curtis distance matrix directly.
Taxa which were primarily responsible for an observed
difference between groups were identified by SIMPER
(similarity percentage analysis) method and their contri-
bution to groups (between and within groups) were ana-
lyzed using the PCA variance-covariance type ordination
(PAST software) method. Differential abundance analysis
(non-parametric ANOVA with Benjamini-Hochberg FDR-
corrected P values < 0.05) was performed on the RA of
microbiota data at different levels of taxonomy to identify
taxa with FDR-corrected P values < 0.05 (XLSTAT soft-
ware; Addinsoft, USA) and then their RA (normalized
to percentage) were shown by a heat map with hierarchal
clustering (HCN) analysis using GraphPad Prism ver-
sion 7.01 (La Jolla, CA). Linear discriminant analysis
(LDA) effect size (LEfSe) is a biomarker discovery and
explanation tool
for high-dimensional data. It couples
statistical significance with biological consistency and ef-
fect size estimation  Microbiota-based biomarker
discoveries were done with LEfSe using the online galaxy
server (https://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/galaxy/), and
the LDA scores derived from LEfSe analysis were
used to show the relationship between taxon using a
cladogram (circular hierarchical tree) of significantly in-
creased or decreased bacterial taxa in the gut microbiota
between groups. Levels of the cladogram represent, from
the inner to outer rings, phylum, class, order, family, and
genus. Color codes indicate the groups, and letters indi-
cate the taxa that contribute to the uniqueness of the cor-
responding groups at an LDA of > 2.0. Unweighted

 The predicted genes and functions were aligned to
the KEGG database (version 66.1, May 1, 2013). PCA
and PERMANOVA statistics were applied to check
whether the groups were clustered according to pre-
dicted gene enrichments for microbial functions. LEfSe
analysis was utilized to determine significant puta-
tive KEGG orthologs and pathway analyses .

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) concentration
Serum LPS concentrations were measured with a Toxin
Sensor Chromogenic Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL)
Endotoxin Assay Kit (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ), follow-
ing the manufacturer’s instructions  Briefly, serum
samples were diluted 10- to 50-fold with endotoxin-free
water, adjusted to the recommended pH, and heated for
10 min at 70 °C to minimize inhibition or enhancement
by contaminating proteins. LAL reagents were added to
serum and incubated at 37 °C for 45 min, and the ab-
sorbance was read at 545 nm. All samples were validated
for recovery and internal coefficient variation using
known amounts of LPS..

Intestinal permeability
Intestinal permeability was determined as previously de-
scribed  Briefly, mice were gavaged with phosphate
buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) containing 600 mg/kg body
weight FITC-dextran 
Blood samples were collected after 90 min.
Serum was diluted with an equal volume of PBS, and
fluorescence intensity was measured using a fluorospec-
trophotometer (excitation wavelength 480 nm and emis-
sion wavelength 520 nm; Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA).
Serum FITC-dextran concentrations were calculated
from a standard curve of serially diluted FITC-dextran
in PBS..

Cell culture experiments
The human colon carcinoma cell line (Caco-2) was ob-
tained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)
(Rockville, MD) and cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Corning Inc., NY,
USA) containing 4.5 g/l glucose, 4 mmol/l L-glutamine,
and 1 mmol/l sodium pyruvate, and supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (Cell Applications, Inc., San
Diego, CA), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL
streptomycin (Gibco, NY, USA) in a humidified atmos-
phere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. They were routinely subcul-
tured when they were about 80% confluent. The culture
medium was changed every other day. Cells were always
> 90% viable, as shown by trypan blue (Invitrogen, Carls-
bad, CA, USA) exclusion. Cells were passaged every 3–
4 days by treatment with 0.1% trypsin (Gibco) and 0.04%
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and then plated
at a density of 1.3–2 × 104 cells/cm2. Cells at passage
number 17 were used for the experiments. All assays
were done using only differentiated Caco-2. Cells were
seeded in to six-well plates at 2 × 104 cells per well and
treated with vehicle (ethanol or DMSO) or 10 nM
17β-estradiol (E2) for 24, 48, and 72 h or each 25 μM

In a
experiments, Caco-2 cells were
pre-treated with L-phenylalanine for 24 h and
then they were treated with either vehicle or each
25 μM G+D mixture or 10 nM E2 for 72 h. Medium
was removed and cells were washed twice with ice-cold
PBS, scraped, lysed in Trizol (Invitrogen), and stored at
− 80 °C until mRNA was isolated or homogenized with
200 μL radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer
(50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton

incubated on ice for 30 min, centrifuged at 14,000g for
10 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was collected and
stored at − 80 °C for western blotting analysis..

Western blotting analysis of IAP
Western blotting on tissues and Caco-2 cell lysates was
performed as previously described  After thawed,

mogenates were centrifuged at 15,000g at 4 °C for
15 min, and the supernatants were collected. The duo-
denum section of small intestinal tissues was harvested

removed. The tissues were washed with PBS and ho-
mogenized with liquid nitrogen, and homogenates were
mixed with RIPA buffer, incubated on ice for 30 min,
and centrifuged at 14,000g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the
supernatant was collected. Protein concentration of
Caco-2 and tissue homogenates was quantified by the
Coomassie blue protein assay (Thermo Scientific, Rock-
ford, IL, USA) using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the
standard. Proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE
gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes
(Osmonics, Minnetonka, MN, USA). The membranes
were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered
saline with 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T) for 1 h at room
temperature and then probed with IAP primary anti-
bodies (GTX27322, GeneTex, San Antonio, TX, USA) in
5% non-fat dry milk in TBS-T at 4 °C overnight. After
washing three times in TBS-T, the blots were further in-
cubated with the corresponding secondary antibodies
conjugated with horseradish peroxidase for 1 h at room
temperature (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz,
CA). Chemiluminescence was detected with Pierce ECL
western blotting substrate (Thermo Scientific, Rockford,
IL, USA) and visualized by ChemiDoc MP Imaging Sys-
tem (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA)..

RV coefficient
The RV coefficient was calculated between the microbial
genera (FDR-corrected P value < 0.05) and the host pa-
rameters (markers of ME, LGCI and MS). The RV coeffi-
cient
the Pearson
correlation coefficient .

Correlation network analysis
Network-based analytical approaches have the potential
to help disentangle complex host-microbe interactions
 Pairwise correlations between each microbiota
(genera that are present at < 0.1% relative abundance in
> 75% samples have been removed to avoid detecting
spurious correlations among low-abundance OTUs) and
host parameter (markers of ME, LGCI, and MS) were
calculated using Spearman’s nonparametric rank correl-
ation coefficient  Using those significant (P < 0.05)
correlation coefficients, a correlation network (Fruchter-
man Reingold and label adjust layout) was built where
nodes represent either a microbiota or a host parameter..

For each microbiota and a host parameter, an undirected
edge was added between the corresponding nodes in the
correlation network. Edges (light black links indicate
positive and blue links indicate negative associations)
represent statistically significant correlations (P < 0.05).
Correlations were calculated using the PAST software
version 2.17 and the network was visualized in Gephi
Graph Visualization and Manipulation software version
0.9.2  Nodes were colored based on “data type”
and sized based on “betweeness centrality (BC).” BC is a
network centrality measure that quantifies the influence
of a node in connecting other nodes in a network. It rep-
resents the fraction of all shortest paths in the network
that pass through a given node. The nodes with the
highest BC are usually known as highly central or hubs.
A “module or component” in the network is a set of
nodes connected to each other by many links, while
connected by few links to nodes of other groups, so
modules are elementary units of any biological network,
and their identification and characterization provides us
with more information about the local interaction pat-
terns in the network and their contribution to the over-
all structure, connectivity, and function of the network.
Modules are biologically important when considered as
isolated, taxonomic, evolutionary, or functional modules.
High modularity indicates that the network has dense
connections within certain groups of nodes and sparse
connections between these groups..

Multivariate statistical analysis
Partial least square regression (PLS-R) was used to asso-
ciate the microbial composition to host parameters in-
cluding jackknife-based variable selection  PLS-R is
recommended in cases of regression where the number
of explanatory variables is high, and where it is likely
that
the explanatory variables are correlated. Leave
one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) was applied. The Q2
cumulated index (Q2cum) measures the global goodness
of fit and the predictive quality of the models. Q2cum is
also used to test
the model against
the validity of
over-fitting. The cumulated R2Y and R2X cum that cor-
responds to the correlations between the explanatory
(X) and dependent (Y) variables with the components
are very close to one with two components in all the
models. This indicates that the two components gener-
ated by the PLR-R summarize well both the Xs and the
Ys. The results are also presented in PLS scatter plots
for subject clustering and variables. The R2 (coefficient
of determination) indicates the % of variability of the
dependent variable (Y) which is explained by the
explanatory variables (X). Parameters (variable import-
ance in the projection values 1 or > 1.0) contributing to
the multivariate PLS models were compared with the
corresponding identified modules 
in the.

Statistical analysis
Data was shown as mean ± standard error of mean
(SEM). Box-plots (box showing the median, and the
25th and 75th percentiles, and the whiskers of the graph
show the largest and smallest values) were also used to
express the data. Unpaired Student’s t test was per-
formed for experiments having only two groups. Either
ordinary or repeated measures one-way or two-way ana-
lysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s or Sidak’s mul-
tiple comparisons post-test were used for experiments
having more than two groups. If unequal variance was
detected, data were analyzed using non-parametric tests.
Differences were considered significant at P < 0.05. Stat-
including heat-map preparation, were
istical analyses,
performed using GraphPad Prism version 7.01 (Graph-
Pad Software, La Jolla, CA). Differential expression
analysis on 16S sequencing data was conducted using
XLSTAT software program  Multivariate statistical
analyses and power analyses (alpha = 0.05; effect size =
0.8) were conducted using PAST (version 2.17) and
XLSTAT (version 2017.6) software products..
