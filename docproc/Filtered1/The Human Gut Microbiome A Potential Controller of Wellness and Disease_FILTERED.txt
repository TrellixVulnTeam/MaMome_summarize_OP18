The human microbiome comprises of collective genomes of
microbiota inhabiting us, namely protozoa, archaea, eukaryotes,
viruses and predominantly bacteria that live symbiotically on and
within various sites of the human body. Examples of occupied
habitats include our oral cavity, genital organs, respiratory tract,
skin and gastrointestinal system (Lloyd-Price et al., 2016). The
human microbiota is estimated to be ∼1013–1014 microbial
cells, with around 1:1 microbial cells to human cells ratio
(Sender et al., 2016). These numbers are derived from the
total bacterial cells in colon  the organ
that harbors the densest number of microbes (Sender et al.,
2016). The diverse gastrointestinal microbiota is predominantly
composed of bacteria from three major phyla, namely Firmicutes,
Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria (Tap et al., 2009). This diverse
and complex microbiome serves as a functional expansion of
host genomes, and is estimated to harbor 50- to 100-fold
more genes, compared to the host. These extra genes have
added various types of enzymatic proteins which were non-
encoded by the host, and play a critical role in facilitating
host metabolism, thus contributing to the regulation of host
physiology (Hooper and Gordon, 2001). Until recent decades, the
properties of the human microbiome and the host–microbiota
interactions have been largely unknown due to technology
limitations especially in examining non-cultivable microbes
of interest, and lack of population-scale data depicting the
microbiota compositions and functions. However, advances in
sequencing technologies and subsequent large-scale sequence-
based microbiome projects such as the Human Microbiome.

Besides SCFA, gut microbiota-synthesized micronutrients
such as vitamins exhibit beneﬁcial value for both microbial
and host metabolisms. Vitamin-K-producing gut bacteria
namely Bacteroides fragilis, Eubacterium lentum, Enterobacter
agglomerans, Serratia marcescens, and Enterococcus faecium
(Fernandez and Collins, 1987; Cooke et al., 2006) anaerobically
synthesize vitamin K2 (menaquinone) which is essential
in
decreasing vascular calciﬁcation, elevating HDL and lowering
cholesterol levels, contributing to lower risk of cardiovascular
disorders such as atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease
(Kawashima et al., 1997; Geleijnse et al., 2004). Gut microbiota
also serves as an important source of vitamins B for the host
(Salminen et al., 1998; Degnan et al., 2014). Among them,
vitamins B5 and B12, which are exclusively synthesized by
intestinal microbiota, act as coenzyme for extensive range of host
biochemical processes including production of acetylcholine and
cortisol which are required for normal functioning of the nervous
system. Deﬁciency of vitamins B5 and B12 have been linked to
several disorders such as gastrointestinal discomfort, insomnia,
neuropsychological and hematological disorders (Andres et al.,
2004; Gominak, 2016). However, the possible link between loss of
vitamin-producing gut microbiota and disease onset has not yet
been elucidated..

disruptive eﬀects of proinﬂammatory cytokines resulted by
aberrant immune-inﬂammatory axis (Peng et al., 2007; Chen
et al., 2017), whereby the mechanism remains unclear. On the
other hand, commensal SFB was shown to induce intestinal
TH17 cells and production of pro-inﬂammatory IL-17 and IL-
22, enhancing antimicrobial defense and mucosal
immunity

intestinal pathogen Citrobacter rodentium in
gnotobiotic mice model (Ivanov et al., 2009). Besides, according
to Atarashi et al.  ATP which can be contributed
by gut microbiota,
is capable to activate diﬀerentiation of
lamina propria cells (CD70 and CD11c) into TH17. In short,
tight regulation of Treg/TH17 balance by healthy host-gut
microbiota interactions are critical to prevent aberrant immune-
inﬂammatory response..

On the other hand, the emerging modulatory role of gut
microbiota in the ENS had been documented in various studies.
The ENS is crucial for life and is capable in autonomously
the GIT, and
regulating the physiology and function of
bidirectionally communicate with the CNS via vagal pathways,
forming the “gut-brain axis.” The major component of ENS
is the EGC which resembles astrocyte in the CNS. EGCs
form the enteric glial network that critically regulates a variety
of GI functions including exocrine/endocrine secretions, gut
motility, blood ﬂow, and immune-inﬂammatory reactions, via
a complex repertoire of calcium-dependent signaling (Ochoa-
Cortes et al., 2015). Dysfunctions in ENS and EGC have
been implicated in various gastrointestinal disorders (such
as IBD, IBS, postoperative ileus), motility disorder (such as
constipation), neurodegenerative disorder (such as PD) and
infection-induced gut inﬂammation. Given the close proximity
of gut microbiota and the ENS that located throughout the
GIT,
it is not surprised that gut microbiota can aﬀect and
modulate the development and function of ENS. In a study
by Collins et al.  region-speciﬁc signiﬁcant reduction
of myenteric nerve ﬁber density was observed in jejunum
and ileum, but not duodenum of early postnatal GF mice
compared to the SPF mice and ASF colonized mice. In addition,
notably decrease in gut motility of GF mice compared with
SPF and ASF counterparts was observed as well, reﬂecting the
importance of gut microbiota in postnatal development of ENS
in mid-to-distal small intestine, however, the reason underlies
the region-speciﬁc myenteric ganglia reduction remains unclear.
Another study by Kabouridis et al. had demonstrated
marked reduction in mean number and density of mucosal
EGCs in 8-week old GF mice compared to the conventionally-
raised (CONV-R) counterparts, indicating the requirement of
gut microbiota in normal development of mucosal enteric glial
network. The same study also showed that gut microbiota-
dependent EGC normal development does not restricted to
critical early postnatal period as conventionalization of 4-
week old GF mice demonstrated restoration of enteric glial
network..

Improved understanding on antibiotic-induced microbiome
dysbiosis in pathogenesis of CDI and its recurrence has given
rise to development of new promising therapeutic approach
that
involves restoration of gut microbiota, such as FMT.
This therapy has successfully restored gut homeostasis via
re-introduction of gut microbiota from healthy donor feces.
Patients received FMT showed long-lasting elevation of fecal
microbial diversity and a high recovery rate compared
to vancomycin (narrow-spectrum antibiotic) therapy (recovery
rate = 60%) (van Nood et al., 2013). Besides, elevation in gut
Bacteroidetes and Clostridium cluster IV and XIVa (Firmicutes),
and reduction in Proteobacteria were observed post-FMT (van
Nood et al., 2013),
indicating the importance of dominant
microbes such as Bacteroidetes and non-pathogenic Clostridia
member in suppressing C. diﬃcile outgrowth. Similar study by
Konturek et al. also had demonstrated a high healing
rate of CDI post FMT treatment, with no recurrent
CDI observed across 16 months follow-up. Besides, marked
reduction of proinﬂammatory cytokines (such as TNF-α, IL-
1β, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-12), signiﬁcant elevation in plasma level
of human antimicrobial peptide LL-37, along with increase in
beneﬁcial bacteria (such as Lactobacillaceae, Ruminococcaceae,
Desulfovibrionaceae, Sutterellaceae, and Porphyromonadaceae)
were observed in successfully treated patients post FMT.
Although the exact beneﬁcial
strains and the underlying
mechanisms of FMT in conferring high cure rate of CDI have not
yet been clariﬁed, these studies undoubtedly demonstrate a strong
association between gut microbiome and development of CDI,
and shed a light on the potential widespread use of microbiota
displacement therapy in targeting CDI..

Conversely, Nagao-Kitamoto et al. suggested that
gut dysbiosis potentially contributes to IBD pathogenesis. In
this study, elevated pro-inﬂammatory gene expression was
observed in GF mice colonized by gut microbiota isolated
from IBD patients. Colitis-prone genetically predisposed GF
mice colonized by IBD-associated-microbiota developed severe
colitis compared to those that were colonized by healthy
human microbiota. Together these ﬁndings strongly indicate
bidirectional relationship between such disease and gut dysbiosis,
in which dysbiosis potentially contributes to the onset of
IBD and also serves as a secondary consequence of gut
inﬂammation. Example of
the dysbiotic features that are
commonly observed in IBD patients is the reduction in gut
Firmicutes such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Roseburia
sp. (Sokol et al., 2008; Willing et al., 2010; Machiels et al.,
2014). These bacteria play an important anti-inﬂammatory role
in reducing pro-inﬂammatory cytokines (IL-12, IFN-γ) and
increasing anti-inﬂammatory IL-10 (Sokol et al., 2008). Besides,
Firmicutes is important producer of butyrate, the primary energy
substrates for colonocytes. Therefore, reduction in Firmicutes
could elicit or heighten local inﬂammation by decreasing anti-
inﬂammatory cytokine, an important regulator of mucosal
immunity, and/or by SCFA-deﬁciency-induced impairment in
colonic barrier function (Peng et al., 2007; Machiels et al.,
2014). As such, it may be interesting to explore the therapeutic
use of probiotic F. prausnitzii
in managing IBD. Another
dysbiotic feature observed in IBD patients is the elevation of
virulent gut microbes such as Enterobacteriaceae species and
Bacteroides fragilis with both having high endotoxic LPS in their
outer membranes (Ruseler-van Embden and Both-Patoir, 1983;
Darfeuille-Michaud et al., 1998). High endotoxic LPS expressed.

layer and
inﬂammatory response. Gastrointestinal mucus
antimicrobial peptides (such as human defensins) secreted
from epithelium work together as a barrier in preventing direct
contact of luminal gut microbiota with gastrointestinal epithelial
cells and inhibit aberrant inﬂammation (Johansson et al., 2008;
Salzman et al., 2010). Colon biopsy samples of patients with
UC showed reduced mucus layer, defective epithelium and
deep microbe- and leukocyte-inﬁltration in colon mucosa
(Swidsinski et al., 2007). Moreover, reduction in antimicrobial
peptides such as Paneth cells alpha-defensins in patients
with ileal CD was reported (Wehkamp et al., 2005). These
ﬁndings propose that the impaired host antimicrobial defense
in mucus barrier reduces the initial suppression of certain
commensal microbiota such as mucolytic bacteria. This is further
supported by Png et al. where they observed a signiﬁcant
elevation of mucolytic Ruminococcus sp. in gut microbiome
of IBDs patients. Decrease in microbial growth inhibition by
human defensins could enable outgrowth of mucolytic species,
resulting in increased mucolytic species that feast on the mucus
leading to deeper penetration of the inner mucosa

Since IBD involves heightened host inﬂammatory response,
current therapeutic approaches generally target the aberrant

Anti-inﬂammation therapies
targeting
proinﬂammatory cytokines (anti-TNF-alpha, anti-IL12, anti-
IL23) and employing α4β7-integrin antagonist
to inhibit
traﬃcking of T-lymphocytes to gut tissue (Feagan et al., 2013;
Christensen et al., 2015). However, IBD tends to recur in
long-term, and chronic treatment with immuno-suppressive
agents will develop neurotoxic side eﬀects (Hyde et al., 1998;
Croft et al., 2013). Therefore, development of a safer and more
eﬀective novel treatment is in great need. Given the association of
IBD patients with decreased anti-inﬂammatory cytokines IL-10,
administration of genetically modiﬁed probiotic (beneﬁcial
microorganism) such as Lactococcus lactis to express IL-10 had
demonstrated a signiﬁcant remission of disease activity in CD
patients during trial (Braat et al., 2006). In this study, 80% CD
patients demonstrated clinical improvements, with 50% showing
complete remission, and no severe side eﬀect was observed, thus,
indicating a promising and safer maintenance treatment strategy
for chronic intestinal disease, as compared to sole administration
of inﬂammatory cytokines. However, 40% patients developed
CD relapse upon discontinuation of such therapy, indicating
the need of long-term prescription of this medication, which in
turn will impact its economic viability. Besides, administration
of prebiotics (fermentable polysaccharides) to stimulate growth
and metabolic activity of beneﬁcial protective gut microbes
such as butyrate-synthesizing bacteria might be an attractive
concept to treat gastrointestinal inﬂammation in IBD (Joossens
et al., 2012; De Preter et al., 2013). Positive outcome had been
reported in a randomized controlled trial by De Preter et al.
 whereby around 40–50% of CD patients with mild to
moderately active disease achieved remission post treatment
with prebiotic OF-IN. OF-IN intake induced a signiﬁcant
reduction in mucolytic Ruminococcus gnavus and a marked.

Celiac Disease
Furthermore, evidence has pointed to dysbiosis as the possible
risk factor of autoimmune disorders, such as celiac disease.
Other examples of gut microbiome-associated autoimmune
disorders such as Type 1 diabetes, SLE and RA are depicted
in Table 3. Celiac disease is a multifactorial chronic immune-
mediated disorder in small intestine characterized by permanent
intolerance to dietary gluten (such as gliadin peptides) and
prolamines in genetically predisposed individuals expressing
human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2 and/or HLA-DQ8 (Sanz
the most
et al., 2011). Celiac disease serves as one of
prevalent lifelong disease in Europe, aﬀecting 1% of the general
population of all ages (Mustalahti et al., 2010), contributing
to absolute mortality rate of 10.4 per 1000 person-years in
celiac disease (Ludvigsson et al., 2009). In celiac patients,
gluten triggers the activation of adaptive immune response
in mucosa,
inducing TH1 and TH17 mediated production
of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines [for example IL-21, interferon
(IFN)-gamma, TNF-alpha]; as well as innate immune response
through stimulation of IL-15 synthesis, consequently leading
to NKG2D-mediated enterocyte killing (Stepniak and Koning,
2006). Gliadin-mediated zonulin (a type of
junction
protein) signaling activation also had been reported, whereby
it causes cytoskeleton rearrangement, reduced occludin – ZO-
1 protein–protein interaction and increased gut permeability,
allowing traﬃcking of luminal antigens to the submucosa (Drago
et al., 2006). The etiology of celiac disease remains to be fully
elucidated, with several factors including genetic predisposition,
immunological factors (mucosal IgA), and environmental factors
including gluten consumption, breast-feeding duration as well
as gut infections (for example rotavirus infection), have been
postulated to serve a concerted eﬀort
in contributing the
(Akobeng et al.,
risk and timing of celiac disease onset
2006; Mulder and Mulder-Bos, 2006; Stene et al., 2006).
These factors also play a critical role in shaping and altering
gut microbiota composition, therefore potentially modulating
gut microbiota roles in gut barrier function and immunity
development..

Besides the aforementioned mTgs-mediated PTMP of dietary
gluten by Firmicutes, PTMP-catalyzing ability had been reported
in other commensal microbes,
including those potentially
virulent strains associated in the dysbiotic feature of celiac
disease. Bacteroides fragilis of Bacteroidetes phylum was found
to encode protein-modiﬁer ubiquitin,
suggesting potential
aberrant ubiquitin especially in a dysbiotic conﬁguration (such
as over-representation of Bacteroides in celiac disease) might
cross-react and interfere human ubiquitin activity, and its
downstream signaling, as well as induce inappropriate activation
of host immune (Patrick et al., 2011). Gram-negative bacteria,
especially those pathogenic strains exhibit secretion systems to
synthesize eﬀector proteins with several enzymatic properties to
manipulate host cellular signaling, for example via modiﬁcation
of host phosphoproteome to facilitate microbial survival and
niche establishment in host (Grishin et al., 2015). Linking
the dysbiotic features, microbial-mediated PTMP activities
with the aberrant
immune-inﬂammatory response in celiac
disease, it is hypothesized that dysbiosis-mediated dysregulated
PTMP activities causing both functional and conformational
transformations of dietary and host proteins, generating novel
aberrant epitopes which are potentially immunogenic and
capable to interfere critical host cellular signaling, hence,
triggering manifestation of autoimmune disease such as celiac
disease (Lerner et al., 2016)..

Alteration in SCFAs compositions and the SCFA total
abundance in celiac children were also been documented by
Tjellström et al.  Signiﬁcant increase in acetic, i-butyrate,
i-valeric acid and the total SCFAs level were observed in
celiac disease patients compared to that of healthy controls.
Intriguingly, no signiﬁcant diﬀerence of SCFAs composition and
the total SCFAs was observed in the untreated celiac patient.

Gluten-free diet has been largely employed to ameliorate
the deleterious disease symptoms in celiac patient. However,
gluten-free diet exhibits therapeutic limitation which it allows
only a partial recovery of gut microbiota in celiac disease
patients, both microbiologically (for example reduction in
certain potentially pathogenic strains, incomplete restoration
of beneﬁcial Biﬁdobacteria) and metabolically (for example
indiﬀerent SCFA pattern in treated and non-treated patient),
possibly due to the genetic factor of the patient, or the selective-
enumeration of gut microbiota mediated by the absence of
dietary gluten, which the underlying reason remains unclear.
Strict adherence to total gluten-free diet appears challenging
to the patient as well due to the vast application of gluten in
processed food, hence alternative measures using microbiome-
based therapy such as probiotic might be a promising option
to manage celiac disease. Several in vivo, animal studies as
well as human studies had demonstrated various beneﬁcial
eﬀects of probiotics Biﬁdobacterium and Lactobacillus strains
in ameliorating epithelial-gliadin induced deleterious eﬀects.
For example, Biﬁdobacterium lactis exerts inhibitory eﬀect on
the increased gut permeability induced by gliadin, and it
protects the healthy curvy appearance of epithelial tight junctions
from the unfavorable gliadin-induced “straightening” eﬀect on
tight junction in human colon Caco-2 cells (Lindfors et al.,
2008). B. longum was shown to be capable in enhancing anti-
inﬂammatory response by stimulating markedly high Treg cell
mediated production of IL-10, suppressing pro-inﬂammatory
TH1 cytokine IFN-gamma induced by fecal microbiota of celiac
patient in a cell culture-based study (Medina et al., 2008).
longum and Lactobacillus casei also have been reported
B.
to exert protective eﬀect on animal model
from gliadin-
induced enteropathy, whereby B. longum can downregulate the
production of pro-inﬂammatory TNF-alpha and reduce CD4+
T-cell mediated immune reactions (Laparra et al., 2012); whilst
L. casei can induce complete recovery of gliadin-induced villus
blunting, recover the basal TNF-alpha level, rescue homeostasis
of GALT (gut-associated lymphoid tissue) (D’arienzo et al.,
2011). Administration of probiotics Biﬁdobacterium in children
with newly diagnosed celiac disease together with gluten-
free diet had signiﬁcantly reduced the potentially harmful
Bacteroides fragilis abundance, decreased peripheral CD3+ T
cells, and improved the disease symptoms (Olivares et al., 2014).
Together, despite complete disease remission is not observed
thus far, these studies demonstrate great therapeutic value of
probiotics Biﬁdobacterium and Lactobacillus in ameliorating
gliadin-induced toxic eﬀects and improving celiac disease.

Since obesity-related metabolic disorder has been associated
with gut microbiota dysbiosis, selective modulation of microbial
composition via dietary intervention such as administration
of prebiotics or probiotics might be a promising therapeutic
approach. Administration of bacterial-synthesized CLA or
CLA-producing bacteria such as Lactobacillus rhamnosus has
shown a signiﬁcant decrease in plasma cholesterol,
triacyl
glycerides and white adipose tissue in animal models (Koba
et al., 2002; Lee H.Y. et al., 2006). Prebiotics
such as
inulin-type fructans that selectively nourish Roseburia and
Clostridium cluster XIVa, and arabinoxylan that increases the
abundance of Biﬁdobacterium, Roseburia, and Bacteroides, have
demonstrated anti-adipogenic eﬀect in high-fat-induced obese
mice (Dewulf et al., 2011; Neyrinck et al., 2011). These
ﬁndings demonstrate promising application of prebiotics and
probiotics in obesity management, however, more supportive
data from human models and clinical trials are required to
justify these treatment strategies and their respective success
rates..

16S rRNA sequencing study of fecal microbiota of CRC
patients has revealed a signiﬁcant enrichment of Bacteroides
fragilis (Wang et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2013). Despite the low
detection limit of some metagenomics studies in providing
strain-level
it is suspected that possible bloom
of enterotoxigenic strains of B. fragilis (ETBF) contributes to
CRC through enhanced production of oncogenic B.
fragilis
enterotoxin (BFT). This speculation is consistent with the
ﬁndings of Ulger Toprak et al. in which the bft
gene expression was signiﬁcantly higher in CRC patients than
healthy controls. Wu et al. had demonstrated that
colonization of tumor-prone mice with ETBF strains can trigger
TH17-dependent colon tumorigenesis, possibly facilitated by its
major virulence factor – BFT. BFT is cytopathic to intestinal
epithelial cells and can cause colitis and colonic tumor, owing
to its capability of catalyzing proteolytic degradation of tight-
junction proteins ZO-1 and E-cadherin, leading to disruption
of intestinal paracellular barriers (Moncrief et al., 1998; Wu
et al., 1998). Moreover, BFT-mediated loss of membrane-
associated E-cadherin could in turn activate T-cell
factor–
dependent Wnt (Wingless-Int)/β-catenin nuclear signaling in
intestinal epithelial cells, stimulating oncogene c-Myc expression
that results in persistent cellular proliferation (Wu et al.,
2003). Furthermore, combined action of BFT and IL-17 on
colonic epithelial cell can induce myeloid diﬀerentiation into
pro-tumoral monocytic-myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MO-
MDSCs),
leading to selective upregulation of Arg1 and NO
synthase 2 (Nos2) thereby stimulating NO synthesis that could
promote vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-mediated
tumor angiogenesis (Cianchi et al., 2003), and suppression of
anti-tumor immunity (e.g., inhibit CD8+ T-cell proliferation)
(Orberg et al., 2017)..

On the other hand, non-colitogenic Fusobacterium nucleatum
which is markedly enriched in CRC patients,
is capable in
inducing intestinal tumorigenesis in murine models, suggesting
overrepresentation of the gut microbiota may be the driver
for CRC that is non-associated with colitis or IBD (Castellarin
et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2013). Although
remain to be
the causality and underlying mechanisms
elucidated,
it has been demonstrated that FadA adhesin of
F. nucleatum could promote bacterial attachment and invasion
into E-cadherin expressing CRC cells, subsequently activating
β-catenin-regulated transcriptions, as shown by upregulation of
lymphoid enhancer factor/T cell factor, host NF-κB, oncogene
c-Myc and cyclin D1, consequently promoting CRC cell
proliferation and inﬂammation (Rubinstein et al., 2013).
Besides, F. nucleatum outer membrane protein, Fap2 also has.

been shown to mediate speciﬁc Fusobacterial attachment to
Gal-GalNAc overexpressed in CRC, facilitating F. nucleatum
invasion and colonization of CRC cells (Abed et al., 2016). In
addition,
involvement of TLR4/phosphorylated-p21-activated
kinase 1/phosphorylated-β-catenin S675 cascade was found
to be employed by invasive F. nucleatum as well (Wu et al.,
2018). Brieﬂy, both oncogenic ETBF and F. nucleatum along
with their respective unique molecular signatures serve as
potential biomarkers in identifying the risk of developing ETBF-
and F. nucleatum-related CRC, and predicting malignancy
progression. Antibiotics speciﬁcally targeting these pathobionts
as well as
inhibitors
the application of pharmacological
for pathogenic signaling pathways may be a promising
approach to be ventured in. Further longitudinal studies
are therefore recommended to assess the feasibility of such
applications..

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
In recent years, increasing number of studies have explored a
possible link between the gut microbiome and brain- or neuro-
developmental disorders, such as ASD, with symptoms like
mood disorder (depression), neurodegenerative Alzheimer’s and
PDs (Table 3). ASD is a multifarious group of neurobiological
disorders aﬀecting 1 in 68, 8-year-old children in America
(Christensen et al., 2016) and 1 in 160 children globally (World
Health Organization [WHO], 2017). It
is characterized by
social and communication deﬁcits, and repetitive, stereotyped
behaviors (Constantino et al., 2000; Kim and Lord, 2012).
Despite the poorly understood causative factor of ASD, several
studies had observed a signiﬁcant association between ASD,
gastrointestinal dysfunction and dysbiosis in gut microbiota.
Comorbidity analysis of ASD patients revealed high occurrence
symptoms, with the severity positively
of gastrointestinal
associated with that of ASD (Wang L.W. et al., 2011). This co-
occurrence is speculated to be implicated by impaired tyrosine
kinase MET signaling which is important in brain development,.

During the investigation of microbiota composition in
ASD patients, dysbiotic features such as increased Clostridium
sp., Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillus, Desulfovibrio, and reduced
Biﬁdobacteria were reported (Song et al., 2004; Adams et al.,
2011), suggesting a possible link between dysbiosis and ASD.
In a study by Shultz et al.  mice treated with PPA
via intra-cerebroventricular injection had shown to develop
brain abnormalities and ASD-like symptoms. PPA is a type of
SCFA, synthesized by enteric bacteria include the aforementioned
Clostridium, Bacteroidetes, and Desulfovibrio species, but PPA
level usually exist at low levels in normal healthy individuals.

This
microbes leads to elevated neurotoxic PPA concentration in
blood, contributing to neuropsychiatric disorders. However, to
date, dysbiosis-associated elevation in microbial-synthesized PPA
in plasma of ASD patients has not been reported. Future
studies in examining plasma PPA level in ASD patients are
required. Surprisingly,
targeting gut microbiome
has demonstrated beneﬁcial eﬀects in alleviating ASD-like
symptoms in murine model. Desbonnet et al. reported
that probiotic Biﬁdobacterium infantis improved the behavioral
abnormalities and stress-associated gastrointestinal dysfunction
which were initially induced in mice suﬀering MS. Reduction in
Biﬁdobacterium is commonly observed in ASD patients, positive
outcome post-probiotic treatment indicates a potential protective
role of Biﬁdobacterium in neuro-immune aspects, suggesting
probiotic B.
infantis as a potential ASD therapy. Despite
the unclear underlying mechanisms, antioxidant properties of
Biﬁdobacterium are suggested to have a neutralizing neurotoxic
eﬀect, induced by excess NO in ASD (Yui et al., 2016). Further
studies that mimic the human physiological environment are very
much required to assess the therapeutic success and underlying
mechanism of probiotic B. infantis in managing ASD..

dysregulation or alteration of gut microbiome. Perturbation of
such delicate equilibrium will
in turn contribute to disease
manifestation. However, the causal or correlation link remains
debatable due to lack of direct evidence and mechanistic
details. Our understanding on gut microbiome is still at a
very preliminary stage, whereby there are several limitations
and research gaps that are worth further exploration to better
justify the link. For instance, large-scale longitudinal studies
that account for subject-speciﬁc variations in characterizing the
human microbiome are strongly required. On the other hand,
another important component of human microbiome – the
human virome that is dominated by bacteriophage (viruses that
infect bacteria), is relatively less established compared to that
of commensal bacteriome research. Only recently the presence
of bacteriophage (or phage) in the human microbiome has
been highlighted. Their potential role in modulating immune
homeostasis has been suggested via indirect mechanisms
such as through regulating bacterial microbiome composition
(phage-mediated lytic killing of host bacteria) and function
(phage-mediated introduction of novel
functional genes to
lysogenic host such as production of endotoxin and antibiotic
resistance), and direct interference with human immune-
inﬂammatory responses such as downregulation of the pro-
inﬂammatory NF-κB pathway,
inhibition of excessive ROS
synthesis,
induction of anti-inﬂammatory IL-10 production,
and T4 phage adhesin gp12 - mediated counteraction to
LPS-induced inﬂammation, as evidenced by downregulation
inﬂammation markers IL-1α and IL-6, and diminished
of
leukocyte inﬁltration (Górski et al., 2016; Miernikiewicz et al.,
2016). In addition, simultaneous increase in pro-inﬂammatory
markers such as IL-1β, IL-1α, along with upregulation in anti-
inﬂammatory IL-1 receptor antagonist and SOCS3 have been
observed in P. aeruginosa and S. aureus phages treated cells,
and the authors postulate that at
least some phages have
evolved anti-inﬂammatory properties to aid their survival and
propagation, while retaining some pro-inﬂammatory properties
(Van Belleghem et al., 2017). On the contrary to the largely
reported anti-inﬂammatory properties of phage, signiﬁcantly
increased abundance of bacteriophages and changes in phage
communities composition in CD patients compared to healthy
controls have indicated a possible contributory role of phage
in aberrant immune response (Lepage et al., 2008; Wagner
et al., 2013). Undeniably, integrating human virome studies
into the existing human bacterial microbiome will provide
a bigger and clearer picture on how such transkingdom
interactions could impact human health, thus, facilitating disease
etiology studies. However, overcoming the obstacles such as
limitations in virome sequencing techniques, uninformative
database for characterization of novel viral genomes and the
diﬃculties in identifying origin of virus from patient sample
followed by deciphering the underlying mechanisms are urgently
required..
