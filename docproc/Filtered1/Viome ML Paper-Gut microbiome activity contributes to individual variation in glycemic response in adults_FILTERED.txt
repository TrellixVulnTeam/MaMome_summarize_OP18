The following exclusion criteria were used: 
age<18; dietary restrictions that would prevent 
adherence to any of the study diets; antibiot-
ic use 1 month prior to or during study; skin 
disease (e.g. contact dermatitis) that precludes 
proper attachment of the CGM; pregnancy; ac-

150 participants, 37% were Asian, 33% were Hispanic, and 30% were 
Black  or  Other.  The  study’s  Research  Protocol  was  approved  by  an 
accredited  IRB  committee  and  all  study  participants  consented  to 
participating in the study. All study participants were at least 18 years 
old. We obtained a stool sample at participation enrollment, as well as 
a comprehensive questionnaire describing their lifestyle, preferences, 
and health history. We collected blood glucose measurements every 
15  minutes  using  a  Continuous  Glucose  Monitor  (CGM)  sensor  that 
measures glucose levels within the range of 40 to 500 mg/dL [Abbott 
2016]. .

Study Meals
As  described  in  Figure  2,  participants  were  provided  pre-designed 
breakfasts,  snacks,  and  lunches  (“provided  meals”)  over  14  days 
(“day  0”  to  “day  13”).  After  lunch,  participants  were  allowed  to  eat 
whatever they wanted (“free meals”) without further guidance on the 
composition, and day 0 consisted of only free meals. Provided meals .

Both  provided  and  free  meals  were  recorded  by  all  participants 
during  the  entire  study  period,  using  a  smartphone  app  (Bitesnap). 
We  obtained  macronutrient  and  micronutrient  information  from  the 
smartphone  app  platform  for  further  analysis.  Provided  meals  were 
pre-loaded  into  the  app.  Free  meals  were  loaded  by  users  through 
selection of custom dishes, ingredients, and quantities..

We  asked  the  participants  to  not  perform  intense  exercise  2.5 
hours before or 2.5 hours after meals, to not start probiotics or pre-
biotics, to not take vitamins or supplements during the study (with a 
specific detail to avoid interfering substances as defined in [Abbott 
2016]),  to  not  take  over-the-counter  medication,  and  to  inform  the 
study coordinator if they are prescribed antibiotics during the study..

In order to test our methodology across a range of diets and to 
support  a  range  of  participant  preferences,  we  provided  two  diet 
types – omnivore and vegetarian/gluten-free – in different phases of 
the study. We provided 104 unique pre-designed meals — 71 unique .

pre-designed meals in the omnivore diet in two separate waves, and 
33  unique  pre-designed  meals  in  the  vegetarian/gluten-free  diet  in 
one wave. 140 participants signed up for the omnivore diet and 410 
signed up for the vegetarian/gluten-free diet..

To  distribute  macronutrients  across  all  the  meals,  we  designed 
the provided meals using a high (H) / low (L) determination of each 
of the 4 macronutrients – carbs, fiber, protein, and fat – as shown in 
Figure 2A. In this paper, we use the terms carbs and carbohydrates 
interchangeably to mean net carbohydrates, i.e. excluding fiber. High 
(H) and Low (L) were thresholded based on the proportion of each 
macronutrient and their daily recommended allowance. For example, 
day 1 breakfast was high (H), low (L), high (H), low (L), respectively, 
in  carbs,  fiber,  protein,  and  fat.    An  example  meal  plan  is  shown  in 
Figure 2B; over the 14 day period (day 0 consisted of only free meals), 
participants were provided with 39 meals, including one glucose drink. 
The  distribution  of  macronutrients  (Figure  2C)  shows  the  coverage 
of the provided meals within the space of macronutrient proportions.
Figure 2B includes 3 distinct meals that were repeated on days 1 
and 8. A total of 9 distinct meals shown in Figure 2D were repeated 
over the course of the 14 day diet schedules (omnivore and vegetar-
ian/gluten-free)  to  collect  information  regarding  intra-person  vari-
ability; each repeat meal was consumed twice by study participants. 
By design, these repeat meals were generally high in just one or two 
macronutrients. .

Meal  data  was  pre-processed  as  follows.  After  discarding  meals 
that were clearly from malfunctioning CGMs or from erroneous data 
capture,  we  ended  up  with  27630  total  meals,  with  18208  provided 
meals and 9422 free meals. All provided meals were at least 2.5 hours 
apart (participants were instructed). Free meals that were within 30 
mins  were  merged,  and  those  within  90  minutes  of  each  other  dis-
carded. After all of this pre-processing, each participant provided an 
average of approximately 50 meals. .

Microbiome Features
Stool  samples  from  participants  were  processed  using  our  meta-
transcriptomic  method  [Hatch  2019]  to  yield  raw  microbiome  data 
features  including  KEGG  gene  orthologs  (or  “KOs”)  [KEGG]  and 
microbial taxonomy. Our cloud-based bioinformatic pipeline performs 
read QC/trimming, host read filtering, and taxonomic classification at 
three taxonomic ranks (strain, species and genus) through sequence 
alignment to a custom database of more than 110,000 genomes. Func-
tional assignments (KOs) are obtained through alignment to the IGC 
[Li 2014] and KEGG databases. For the samples provided by the 550 
participants in this study, 6587 unique microbial KOs were detected, a 
mean of 2941.9 per sample (s.d. 541.9); and 1047 unique species were 
detected, with a mean of 122.7 (s.d. 40.5).  .

Collections of these raw microbiome data features were aggregat-
ed into custom microbiome scores designed to capture the collective 
functional characteristics as described in the literature. For example, 
the score microbiome balance, is an aggregate assessment of overall 
ratios of active beneficial and harmful microbes, as well as some di-
versity metrics. This score is binary with a value of “Low” or “Normal”. 
All  microbiome  scores  are  generated  by  taking  expression  data  as 
input, and applying an expert-designed scoring algorithm developed 
at Viome [Perlina et al, in prep.] to derive an overall activity level..

Metabolic  and  signaling  pathway  activities  are  scored  using  ex-
pression levels of genes encoding specific protein functions (KEGG 
mappings  are  used  primarily),  compared  with  a  reference  cohort  of 
samples supplied by Viome customers. Scores measure the quantity 
and expression levels of specific KEGG gene orthologs (KOs) selected 
due to their specific directional enzymatic roles, pathway topology, or 
significance in the functional literature. The more key genes expressed, 
and the higher their expression levels, the higher the resulting score..

RESULTS
Meal Effects
For the remainder of our analyses we look at incremental area under 
the  curve  (iAUC),  a  standard  assessment  of  PPGR  ([Cheng  2018]; 
[Wolever 1986]). We define this as the integrated area under the CGM 
curve over 120 minutes, relative to the baseline CGM measured at the 
time of the meal, i.e., the difference between the area above baseline 
and area below baseline. Note that this measurement can be negative 
due to decline in blood sugar level below the baseline over time, es-
pecially after activity, and due to noise from the measurement device. 
The actual iAUC values for all meals, the repeated meals from Figure 
2D, and the glucose drink are shown in Figure 3A. .

Predictive Model Development and Evaluation
In this section we first present a linear multilevel mixed-effects or hier-
archical model [Gelman 2007] of PPGRs based on the data described 
above.  The  linear  model  allows  us  to  provide  a  concise  description 
of the relationships between nutrients, anthropometrics, microbiome 
activity,  and  PPGR.  Additionally,  it  allows  us  to  derive  significance 
statistics testing the hypotheses that each predictor is relevant in the 
determination of the PPGR..

Importantly,  the  inclusion  of  random  effects  captures  individual 
variation  in  PPGR  due  to  unobserved  factors  (unknown  properties 
of the individual, meal, or measurement devices) that may affect the .

outcome. Including random effects is essential in order to derive con-
servative hypothesis tests of both the relevance and magnitude of our 
fixed  effects,  especially  in  a  repeated-measures  design  where  each 
person and each meal provide many data points. Our experimental de-
sign calls for a multilevel model because of this repetition; each PPGR 
observation is at a lower level nested within one person and within one 
meal (higher levels), in a crossed or fully factorial experimental design 
(see Figure 4A). For example, without the multilevel model we could 
not conclusively test the importance of any variable that is constant 
across all data taken from one person, such as microbiome features..

Model  development  was  performed  using  the  lme4  package  in 
R [Bates 2015]. The model was built incrementally. In the first pass, 
we  determined  appropriate  transformations  for  the  nutritional  and 
anthropometric  variables  by  visualizing  the  relationship  between 
each predictor and the iAUC. The effect of carbohydrates appeared 
to be well-described by the square root transformation, while other 
predictors were left untransformed. We then fitted a model of these 
nutritional  and  anthropometric  predictors  as  fixed  effects,  and  ran-
dom intercepts and slopes allowing the nutritional effects to vary be-
tween people and the anthropometric effects to vary between meals. 
Likelihood  ratio  tests  showed  no  evidence  for  any  random  slopes 
of anthropometrics by meal (i.e., responses to all meals are similarly 
influenced by the participant’s age, BMI, etc)..

As the largest effects were associated with carbs, in the second 
pass we introduced interactions between that and all other nutrients 
as  fixed  effects,  and  with  random  slopes  by  participant.  Based  on 
visual inspection of their relationship with iAUC, we also introduced 
fixed effects of two response-level “context” measurements, minutes 
of activity during the 2 hours following the meal and minutes of sleep 
during the 3 hours before the meal. We removed effects not significant 
by likelihood ratio test at p<.05..

In the third pass, we introduced fixed effects of our microbiome 
features, a number of expert-designed scores measuring the activity 
of crucial metabolic pathways and functions (see discussion section 
below). We determined a candidate set of scores to add to the model 
by predicting participants’ average iAUC from each score using t-test 
(binary)  or  regression  (continuous).  15  scores  showed  a  significant 
association taken alone and were tested in the full model. After con-
trolling for all other predictors, 6 remained significant or marginally 
significant..

The final model fixed-effect coefficients are displayed in Figure 4B. 
Positive coefficients indicate a greater predicted glycemic response. 
All predictors were significant by likelihood-ratio test at p<.05, except 
for  glutamine  production  pathways  (p=.08)  and  the  interaction  be-
tween tyrosine metabolizers and carbs (p=.06) which are kept in this 
model as suggestive, and do not substantially affect the estimation of 
other coefficients..

Several of the significant predictors were microbiome scores. One 
of the scores, named microbiome balance, is an aggregate assessment 
of  microbiome  balance  quantifying  overall  beneficial  and  harmful 
activities (based on the literature), as well as some diversity metrics. 
This score, when “Low,” showed a negative association with glycemic 
response. Two other scores are quantified pathway activities repre-
sentative of overall activity levels of a given set of microbial pathways.
The fucose metabolism pathways activity score considers expres-
sion levels of all the genes that encode enzymes known to carry out .

The  indoleacetate  production  pathways  activity  score  considers 
expression levels of all the genes that encode enzymes known to carry 
out biochemical reactions that result in production of indole-acetate 
(or indole acetic acid, IAA). This binary score, when “High,” showed a 
negative association with glycemic response..

The marginally significant score of glutamine production pathways 
implies  higher  glycemic  response  when  “Low.”  The  score  is  derived 
with the same approach as the indoleacetate score, and assess the 
levels of activity of various pathway axes leading to microbial produc-
tion of glutamate (or glutamic acid)..

Microbial scores for tyrosine and fructose metabolizers are based 
on functional groups of active microbes known to metabolize tyrosine 
and  fructose,  respectively.  Tyrosine  metabolizers,  when  “Low,”  are 
directly related to elevated PPGR. Fructose metabolizers, when “Low,” 
show inverse relationship to glycemic response..

Figure  4C  compares  different  approaches  to  predicting  iAUC. 
The first two plots show single predictor models (calories or carbs). 
We also present predictions from the fixed-effect part of our model 
after  zeroing  out  certain  components.  Using  all  nutrient  predictors 
achieves  a  similar  fit  to  using  the  square  root  of  carbs  alone  (both 
R=.41, not pictured). Including the microbiome features yields a small 
but significant improvement in fit (R=.42, not pictured), and adding 
the other fixed effect predictors (age, BMI, sleep, activity, microbiome) 
improves the fit further (R=.45, Fig. 4C bottom-left). Finally, the full 
model including random effects (best linear unbiased predictions) fits 
the data very well (R=.77, Fig. 4C bottom-right)..

Figure 4D (left) shows the influence of age on the modelled re-
lationship  between  carbs  and  glycemic  response.  Figure  4D  (right) 
illustrates the extent of modeled individual differences in this relation-
ship, taking into account all predictors.  Two hypothetical meals A and 
B (similar to repeat meals from Figure 2D with carbs approximately 
25g and 50g respectively) are shown to illustrate that two users (blue 
and red lines) have the opposite glycemic responses (iAUC of 14 & 20 
vs iAUC of 37 & 27 respectively) due to the crossover of their iAUC 
response  lines  between  the  two  meals  —  this  effect  was  shown  in 
Figure 3D using the raw data. .

A model optimized for prediction accuracy over explanation
As described above, mixed effects linear models are valuable because 
they are easily interpreted and allow statements about the statistical 
significance of predictors. In this section we present another model for 
the same data which does not offer these benefits but achieves great-
er predictive accuracy due to its richer modeling framework. This is a 
gradient boosting machine [Chen 2016] built on the same predictors 
already discussed as well as a number of additional features. These 
encompass  the  microbiome  (activity  of  individual  organisms  and 
genes), nutrients (weight of meal; subtypes of carbs and fats; micro-
nutrients; specific compounds like caffeine and alcohol), and context 
(more detailed representations of sleep and activity). Following [Zeevi 
2015] we also add two further predictors encoding prior blood glucose 
levels: the CGM reading immediately before the meal, and the slope 
of the linear change in CGM readings over the previous 90 minutes. .

However,  in  our  analysis  there  is  no  significant  effect  of  HbA1c  on 
iAUC after controlling for other predictors. This may be because the 
study population was selected for HbA1c in the normal range (< 6.5)..

Data from 82% of users was used to train, with the data from the 
remaining  18%  held  out  for  evaluation.  Hyperparameters  controlling 
learning rate, number of trees and tree depth were estimated using 
cross validation on the training set. .

DISCUSSION
We set out to study the variation of glycemic response based on in-
dividual differences, especially differences in gut microbiome activity 
obtained  via  the  metatranscriptomic  method  for  the  first  time.  We 
made  a  few  key  design  choices  for  the  study,  including  (a)  14  days 
of  monitoring,  (b)  multiple  diet  types  –  omnivore  and  vegetarian/
gluten-free, and (c) a large proportion of “provided” (pre-de-
signed) meals..

The  number  of  provided  meals   is  considerably  larger  in 
our study compared to previous studies (e.g. [Zeevi 2015]; [Mendes-
Soares 2019] had only 4 standardized meals). This design allowed us 
to get more precise readings of consumed meals rather than entirely 
depending on the smartphone diet tracking app. This choice also en-
sures that our data allows us to quantify individual PPGR differences 
between people in response to the same food, reducing the risk that 
observed differences reflect differences between participants’ diets. 
Secondly, as shown in Figure 2A, we wanted to design a diet plan that 
provided broad coverage of the space of macronutrient proportions 
(carbs, fiber, protein, fat) with the intention of teasing out the inde-
pendent and interacting effects of the macronutrients. And finally, we 
needed more control of meals since we also wanted to study the effect 
of  multiple  diet  types:  omnivore  and  vegetarian/gluten-free  (this  is 
ongoing work, not reported here)..

It  is  evident  from  our  data  that  accounting  for  individual  differ-
ences is crucial in providing a full description of PPGRs. We designed 
9  specific  meals,  each  of  which  was  a  combination  of  food  staples 
(Figure 2D), that were consumed twice by all participants. While in-
tra-person variability for a given meal is substantial (Figure 3C, green), 
this variability is small relative to the inter-person variability for the 
same meals (blue). We can conclude that while many factors affect 
PPGRs, some of these factors are individual differences which must 
be accounted for by differences between people and their lifestyles, 
not properties of the meal alone. The two meals where intra-person 
variability  is  close  to  inter-person  variability  are  meals  that  contain 
little to no carbohydrates..

Relationships between iAUC and phenotype and food features
We see the expected relationship between age and iAUC in Figure 3E, 
first panel. The relationship between iAUC and BMI / waist-to-hip ratio 
(Figure 3E second and third panels) is the opposite of that previously 
reported  in  studies  such  as  [Zeevi  2015].  We  hypothesize  that  this 
may  reflect  the  self-reported  good  health  and  high  exercise  rate 
within this study population. We see the expected increase in average 
iAUC  with  HbA1c  in  our  study  population  (Figure  3E,  fourth  panel). .

As expected, the bulk of variation in the response is explained by 
the amount of carbs ingested, and by interactions with fat content in 
food and other factors that modulate the effect of carbs. Increased 
fiber resulted in overall lower PPGRs, and while increased fat had little 
marginal effect by itself, it interacts with carbs to suppress the effect 
of  ingested  carbs  on  the  PPGR.  The  plot  of  the  time-course  of  this 
effect in Figure 3B suggests this may happen because fat and protein 
flatten and delay the digestion of carbs, pushing some of the PPGR 
out  of  the  2  hour  window  considered  here  ([Franz  1997];  [Wakhloo 
1984]). Protein has a numerically negative effect on iAUC but is not 
significant  after  controlling  for  other  predictors,  so  was  removed 
from the final model. Older people had higher PPGRs, and also higher 
PPGRs per unit of carbs ingested (Figure 4D). Activity after meal con-
sumption as well as sleep immediately before eating both resulted in 
lower PPGR to carbs, which is consistent with literature on metabolic 
effects of circadian rhythms [Van Cauter 1997]..

The fact that the PPGR is better predicted by the square root of 
carbs than untransformed carbs is reminiscent of a standard model 
of  gastric  emptying  in  which  the  volume  of  food  passing  from  the 
stomach  per  unit  of  time  is  linear  in  the  square  root  of  its  volume 
[Hopkins 1966]. .

Relationships between iAUC and microbiome features
The significant microbiome features related to prediction of postpran-
dial glycemic response were microbiome balance, fucose metabolism 
pathways,  fructose  metabolizers,  tyrosine  metabolizers  (marginal), 
indoleacetate  production  pathways,  and  glutamine  production 
pathways  (marginal).  Of  these,  fucose,  indoleacetate,  and  tyrosine 
(marginal) scores interact with carbs, indicating that the microbiome 
or  properties  correlated  with  the  microbiome  affect  the  processing 
of carbs as well as leading to an overall difference in baseline blood 
sugar..

The microbiome balance score was one of the significant features 
in  predicting  glycemic  response.    Low  microbiome  balance  scores 
usually result from either an imbalance of relative activities of ben-
eficial  vs.  harmful  microbes  or  from  lower  quantity  and  diversity  of 
microbial organisms. The relationship of suboptimal overall gut micro-
biome and higher PPGR is in line with the current literature [Karlsson 
2013; Larsen 2010; Vrieze 2012] implicating the role of gut health in 
glycemic regulation..

The fucose metabolism pathway score showed a direct relation-
ship  with  PPGR.  Fucose  is  a  sugar  molecule  that  various  microbial 
organisms  can  use  as  an  energy  source  [Chen  1987].  When  other 
carbohydrate sources are not available, gut microbiota can switch to 
using  the  fucose  that  can  be  obtained  from  the  host’s  gut  mucosal 
lining. This process is often carried out by microbes known as mucin 
degraders,  such  as  certain  species  of  genus  Ruminococcus  [Crost 
2016].  We  therefore  hypothesize  that  higher  fucose  consumption 
activity,  as  reflected  by  the  microbiome  pathway  score,  may  be  as-
sociated with microbiomes of those individuals who are either more 
likely  to  fast  or  whose  internal  ecosystem  and  overall  body  state 
resembles the conditions of fasting or calorie deprivation. This may 
explain its association with higher PPGR. More research is needed to .

establish  relationships  between  microbial  metabolism  of  gut  sugars 
and the host’s tendency to show higher glucose spikes in the blood 
after meals..

The  indoleacetate  production  pathways  score  incorporates  the 
role and significance of expressed genes in the context of microbial 
indoleacetate production. The algorithm takes all the known pathway 
axes  that  ultimately  lead  to  microbial  production  of  compounds  of 
type indole acetic acids (IAAs) and scores them using gene expres-
sion as input data. In the case of indole acetate production, the result 
shows that when such pathways score “High” in activity, the glycemic 
response  to  the  given  food  is  lower.  This  is  consistent  with  known 
anti-inflammatory properties of IAA [Krishnan 2018 ; Whitfield-Cargile 
2016]. Inflammatory activities in the gut and their consequential po-
tential to cause systemic low-grade inflammation are implicated in the 
development of Type 2 Diabetes and other metabolic disorders [Gon-
zalez 2018; Tuomainen 2018]. Moreover, there are direct implications 
of IAAs in glycemic response, and some findings suggest hypoglyce-
mic action of indole-3-acetic acid in diabetes mellitus [Mirsky 1956]..

Indoles  and  indoleacetate  are  beneficial  products  of  protein 
fermentation,  and  tryptophan  metabolism  pathway  products  partic-
ularly  [Russell  2013].  In  one  study,  intraperitoneal  administration  of 
indole-3-propionic  acid,  indole-3-butyric  acid,  and  indole-3-acetic 
acid were shown to be associated with hypogIycemia in normal and 
alloxandiabetic mice, while L-tryptophan and kynurenic acid had no 
effect [Silverstein 1966]..

The interpretation we offer here is dependent on the individual’s 
microbiome  function.  If  a  given  person’s  microbiota  mainly  shows 
ability to convert tryptophan to beneficial indoles and indole-actetate 
molecules capable of reducing inflammation and glycemic effects of 
foods,  then  it  may  be  of  benefit  to  recommend  tryptophan  sources 
(in  the  form  of  food  or  supplement)  to  such  people.  On  the  other 
hand, if tryptophan is used by the microbiota to produce more of the 
pro-inflammatory triggers, then such action may not be suitable for 
mitigating glycemic response or inflammation in general..

Tyrosine and fructose metabolizer scores group active microbes 
by  functional  characteristics.  In  our  studies  we  have  observed  that 
active  functional  microbial  groups  reflect  the  host’s  habitual  diet. 
Hence,  “Low”  tyrosine  metabolizers  may  suggest  a  diet  that  is  low 
on protein sources of tyrosine. We also hypothesize that the inverse 
relationship between the fructose metabolizers score and PPGR may 
be due to a diet that is low in fructose, or other carbohydrates that 
serve as metabolic precursors of fructose. It is not yet clear how a diet 
that is rich in fructose or deficient in tyrosine may influence glycemic 
response, and more studies are needed..

Glutamine  production  pathways  score,  when  “Low,”  showed  a 
direct relationship with higher PPGR. Microbial glutamine production 
has not been directly linked to glycemic response in humans. Howev-
er, glutamine is considered an important nutrient for gut health and 
has been included in various supplements used by clinical healthcare 
practitioners to prevent or heal “leaky gut” [Kim 2017, Rao 2012].  More 
research is needed to understand the molecular mechanisms that may 
be  responsible  for  higher  glycemic  response  to  food  in  individuals 
with low microbial glutamine production activity in the gut..

The microbiome features revealed by our glycemic response mod-
el may influence PPGR directly or indirectly. Although it is challenging 
to  delineate  causal  mechanisms,  there  may  be  functional  patterns .

that connect the significant scores with gut health, intestinal barrier 
integrity,  and  inflammation.  Inflammation  and  stress  response  may 
be  implicated  in  elevation  of  blood  glucose  (either  due  to  cortisol 
pathway  or  other  mechanisms).  Knowing  which  foods  may  elicit 
higher personal PPGR can offer valuable guidance in diet selection. 
However, to intervene on the root cause of glycemic response, spe-
cific mechanisms connecting nutrients to the gut microbiome and to 
inflammatory and glycemic response need to be taken into account. 
We seek to confirm and validate these mechanisms. An understanding 
of  which  microbiome  features  are  significant  will  pave  the  path  to 
precise personalization of food and supplement recommendations..

Modeling methods and model evolution
The  multilevel  mixed  effects  model  presented  first  in  the  previous 
section was deliberately chosen to better understand the incremental 
effects  of  the  significant  features,  especially  the  functional  gut  mi-
crobiome  activity  features.  We  are  not  aware  of  any  prior  literature 
that  demonstrates  the  statistical  significance  of  the  microbiome  in 
the context of a predictive model of PPGR. Prior studies [Zeevi 2015] 
using  only  ensemble  methods  such  as  gradient  boosting  machines 
represent the state of the art in accurate prediction of PPGR (which 
we  also  show  in  Figure  4E).  These  models  suffer  from  difficulty  of 
interpretation, including determination of which features significantly 
contribute to the predicted outcome..

We are in the process of increasing the generalizability of our find-
ings by collecting further data from underrepresented subpopulations 
such as pre-diabetics, people reporting poor overall health, and older 
participants. With the goal of continuous improvement, we will rebuild 
and  revalidate  our  model  based  on  this  new  expanded  data.  The 
current paper provides a first snapshot of the collected data, and we 
will use the additional data to consolidate the current model, as well 
as potentially surface new relevant predictors.  Finally, we also plan on 
validating the model on an unseen cohort, and performing a blinded 
randomized controlled dietary intervention based on this predictive 
model to look for improvements in the glycemic response as well as 
alterations to the gut microbiota. .

•  Demonstrates for the first time that metatranscriptomic activity of 
the gut microbiome contributes to individual variation in glycemic 
response among adults..

•  Suggests new microbial features that may help uncover molecular .

•  Demonstrates  the  statistical  significance  of  all  features  using  a 
multilevel  mixed-effects  regression  model  where  fixed  effects 
represent  measured  properties  and  random  effects  account  for 
further variation. We also present a gradient boosting machine for 
maximizing predictive accuracy..

•  Demonstrates that glycemic response is driven by the properties 
of  an  individual  in  addition  to  the  food’s  macronutrient  content, 
measured  with  104  unique  pre-designed  meals  within  omnivore 
and  vegetarian/gluten-free  diet  types  and  within  a  multi-ethnic 
population..
