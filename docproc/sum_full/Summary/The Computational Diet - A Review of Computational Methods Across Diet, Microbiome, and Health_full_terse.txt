Eetemadi et al. Data Analytics and Machine Learning
Data processing is considered to be the step necessary for
converting the raw data, such as metagenomics sequence reads,
into biologically meaningful representations, such as OTU counts
using bioinformatics tools, some of which are done in the
sequencing device itself. For
example, SparCC is used for analyzing the TwinUK dataset to
identify bacterial taxa whose abundances are inﬂuenced by host
genetics (Goodrich et al., In one study, a
classiﬁer was built to predict the geographical origin of sample
donors using relative OTU abundances estimated from 16s
rRNA gut samples (Yatsunenko et al., In scenario B, the goal is to provide
recommended probiotic intake for supporting a healthy gut
