This 
chapter reviews the natural trajectory of the composition 
of  the  microbiota  during  pregnancy  and  early  life  and 
outlines  the  current  knowledge  on  the  interaction  be-
tween the microbiota and neurodevelopment. Mode of Nutritional Provision in Early Life
The stability and composition of the early-life gut mi-
crobiota community is also dependent on diet  Ac-
cumulating evidence suggests that breastfeeding and for-
mula-based nutrition leave a distinctive fingerprint in the 
intestinal  microbiota  (Table  2). Culture-de-
pendent and -independent techniques revealed that it is 
a source of bacteria  Interestingly, the human milk 
microbiome can be influenced by maternal body mass in-
dex and mode of delivery  The other main compo-
nents  of  breast  milk  are  human  milk  oligosaccharides, 
which  act  as  prebiotics    Supplementation  of 
infant formula with GOS increases the abundance of Bi-
fidobacteria and Lactobacilli to levels reported in breast-
fed infants  Both breast milk microbes and pre-
biotics play a role in the standard gut microbial develop-
mental trajectory. The gut 
and  vaginal  microbiome  of  the  mother  is 
altered by diet, drugs and stress. M.G.C. is funded by the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020
