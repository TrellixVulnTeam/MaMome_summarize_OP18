Since each taxon is tested (multiple tests), reported signiﬁcance values must be
interpreted with caution. The Classiﬁer engine and related software
were written in Java (API v1.4.1) and have been tested on the Solaris  Linux
 and Microsoft Windows XP operating systems
using Java virtual machines from Sun and Apple. An online version of the Classiﬁer is available at http://rdp.cme.msu.edu
/classiﬁer. A user can submit one sequence or a group of sequences for classiﬁ-
cation. Single sequences may also be submitted in raw-
text format. Clicking on the “show assignment
detail” link will display the detailed classiﬁcation results for all or a speciﬁed
subset of the user’s queries. Small-subunit rRNA sequences con-
sisting of 5,014 bacterial species type strain sequences in 988 genera (Table 1),
along with associated taxonomic assignment information, were obtained from
Bergey’s Taxonomic Outline of the Prokaryotes (release 5.0   The
sequences averaged 1,460 bases in length and had a range of 1,200 to 1,833 bases. These
sequences are classiﬁed into 1,187 genera in the NCBI taxonomy  Initial
placement into the NCBI taxonomy is based on information provided by the
sequence submitter, with modiﬁcations by the NCBI staff. The Classiﬁer uses a feature space consisting of all possible 8-base
subsequences (words). From the corpus consisting of N se-
quences, let n(wi) be the number of sequences containing subsequence wi. Classiﬁer accuracy versus bootstrap conﬁdence

a Bootstrap conﬁdence reﬂects the frequency of most common assignments
out of 100 bootstrap samplings. Percentages of correct assignments at all ranks
and within this bootstrap conﬁdence range are shown. Both comparison results and classiﬁcation
assignments can be downloaded in text format and imported into a spreadsheet
program for further analysis. The corpus contained
453 genera represented by single sequences. For near-full-length se-
quences, most misclassiﬁcations were probably due to errors in
the underlying taxonomy (see below), but for shorter se-
quences, misclassiﬁcations may reﬂect the lack of data. The k-NN method is another super-
vised classiﬁcation method that is arguably simpler and often
works well in practice  We compared the RDP naı¨ve
Bayesian Classiﬁer with the RDP SeqMatch k-NN classiﬁer. The RDP Clas-
siﬁer misclassiﬁed three sequences from the Alicyclobacil-
laceae: Sulfobacillus disulﬁdooxidans and Sulfobacillus thermo-
sulﬁdooxidans, which were both misclassiﬁed in the genus
Alicyclobacillus, and Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris, which was
misclassiﬁed in the genus Bacillus. Variable regions were, in general, more accurately

TABLE 5. Bootstrap conﬁdence estimates above 85% are
shown. In 2005, S.
thermosulﬁdooxidans strain K1 was reclassiﬁed as the type strain of a
new species, A. tolerans  In our analysis, however, the sequence for
K1 given in the naming paper (accession number AF137502) is 8%
different from that for Z21979. Also, Seq-
Match has been shown to be more accurate than BLAST in
ﬁnding the most similar rRNA sequence as deﬁned by pairwise
aligned distance  The RDP Classiﬁer and RDP SeqMatch
had nearly identical overall error rates. For query sequences from regions of bacterial diversity with
less-deﬁned taxonomy, the RDP Classiﬁer tends to provide
classiﬁcation results with low conﬁdence estimates. For exam-
ple, in one library of Acidobacteria environmental clone se-
quences, 72 of 77 sequences were classiﬁed with less than 80%
conﬁdence even at the phylum level (not shown). The online
version of the Classiﬁer returns results for submissions of up to
10,000 user sequences in a few minutes and provides both
summary and detailed classiﬁcation assignments. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
