Blautia, Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium were extracted and entropy analysis and oligotyping
were carried out since these were the only OTUs showing higher level of entropy able to
obtain sub-OTUs. After the first round of oligotyping, high entropy positions were chosen (-C
option): 8, 12, 113, 223, 224, 247, 432, 433 for Blautia; position 8, 12, 40, 74, 75, 116, 117, 124,
129, 130, 390, 397, 452 and 453 were chosen for Bacteroides; while position 8, 12, 14, 81, 114,
115, 158, 159, 160, 328, 329, 389, 437, 438, 439, 440, 441, 442, 443 and 444 were chosen for Bifi-
dobacterium. In order to reduce the noise, each oligotype should appear in at least 10 samples,
occur in more than 1.0% of the reads for at least ten samples, represent a minimum of 750
reads in all samples combined, and have a most abundant unique sequence with a minimum
abundance of 50. A cladogram of representative sequences was generated using the ANVIOs
software . In order to explore the possible mother-to-infant gut microbiota transmission at sub-OTUs
level, we carried out oligotyping on sequences of Blautia, Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium
since these were the only genera showing a Shannon entropy index sufficient to identify all. abundance of the Blautia oligotypes increased during the pregnancy and were lower in the
infants (S4A Fig). A high degree of mother-offspring concordance was found for B11
(P = 0.008) and B42 (P<0.001); both were identified as Blautia wexlerae by best BLASTn
match. A reduction in the relative abundance of Bacteroides oligotypes was observed across
pregnancy while few oligotypes were observed to be dominant in the offspring samples
(S4B Fig)..

(green bars) and their offspring (blue bars). Inner bars indicate the presence of an oligotype
in a given sample. Outer circle, if colored, denotes oligotype abundance with high degree of
mother-offspring concordance. Amenta, Clara Monzeglio, Roberto Gambino, Simona Bo..
