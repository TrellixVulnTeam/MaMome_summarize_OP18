Abstract: Pregnancy induces a number of immunological, hormonal, and metabolic changes that are
necessary for the mother to adapt her body to this new physiological situation. argued the weakness of evidence supporting the. The classical paradigm of fetal environment as a sterile harbor has traditionally explained that
microbes, and thus microbiome, are acquired both vertically (from the mother) and horizontally (from
other humans or from the environment) during and after birth. In contrast, Paenibacillus predominated in term placental specimens 
Other authors have proposed that the fetal intestinal microbiota derives from swallowed amniotic ﬂuid,
and that they may trigger an inﬂammatory response which leads to premature birth  Considering
that some Lactobacillus strains may possess potential anti-inﬂammatory activities, and could regulate
blood glucose levels in diabetic humans  the low abundance of Lactobacillus in placentas of low
birth weight neonates reported by Zheng et al. They showed an overall increase in pathogenic bacteria such as Clostridium perfringens and Bulleidia
moorei and a reduction in probiotic bacteria Coprococcus catus. may also inﬂuence the alteration of the digestive
functions  Freedberg et al.
