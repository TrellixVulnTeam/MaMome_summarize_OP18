the commonality that relates both BV and vaginal pH to HPV
infection (independent of HIV) is the RA of certain Lactobacil-
lus species, most notably L. crispatus. Therefore, in the current investigation, we combined data
from 2 independently conducted ancillary studies in the Wom-
en’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) cohort: a study involving
serial microbiota and vaginal pH testing and a longitudinal
study of cervicovaginal HPV detection. In a
separate independently conducted study, the presence of HPV
DNA in CVLs was longitudinally assessed semiannually in all
WIHS women with available specimens over a similar period
of 8–10 years or more 

Laboratory Testing
Vaginal pH and Cervicovaginal Specimens
Semiannually, vaginal pH was measured prior to collection of
the CVL by sampling the posterior vaginal pool with a polyeth-
ylene terephthalate swab that was then applied to paper strips
with a pH range of 4–7 (ColorpHast, EM Reagents, MCB Re-
agents, Gibbstown, NJ). Microbial DNA was isolated using the FastDNA Spin Kit for
Soil (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH). Distribution of relative abundance (RA) of Lactobacillus species. All covariates except study group were time
dependent. Furthermore, to study temporal associations related
to changes in CSTs and HPV detection over time, we used
continuous-time multistate Markov models ﬁt using maximum
likelihood, as described in an earlier article  All tests were
2-sided, with a P value of .05 used to deﬁne signiﬁcance. RESULTS

Select characteristics of the cohort at the index visit are shown in
Table 1. Women with rapidly progression of
HIV-associated immunosuppression had a lower CD4+ T-cell
count than HIV-infected women with stable immune status
and HIV-uninfected women (P < .001). Detection of chimeric se-
quences was performed using the UCHIME component of
UCLUST, and chimeric sequences were removed. Statistical Methods
We characterized demographic and risk factor data at the index
visit for each of the 3 study groups, with statistical differences
between groups assessed using analysis of variance (ANOVA;
for continuous variables), the Kruskal–Wallis test (for continu-
ous variables with nonnormal distributions), or the χ2 test (for
categorical data). of STIs in past

preceded widespread use of methods for comprehensively
assessing the cervicovaginal microbiome  The growing ev-
idence of species-speciﬁc (eg, L. crispatus–related) relationships
between the cervicovaginal microbiome and HPV infection ar-
gues against a signiﬁcant role of pH, since production of lactic
acid is a common attribute of lactobacilli as a group, and our
data showed that the greatest association with pH was with
the RA of Lactobacillus species, not for L. crispatus RA or
CSTs dominated by L. crispatus. Thus, biologic mechanisms
other than pH are likely involved in the anti-HPV activity of
L. crispatus. On the other hand, bacteriocins produced by
L. crispatus may have antiviral effects. In summary, our results suggest a beneﬁcial effect of L. crisp-
atus on the burden of HPV in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected
women that is unrelated to pH. Further research to better un-
derstand these relationships is strongly warranted, including
large prospective cohort studies and laboratory research to un-
derstand the mechanisms that underlie the relation of the cer-
vicovaginal microbiota with HPV infection. K. A. has received honoraria from Bris-
