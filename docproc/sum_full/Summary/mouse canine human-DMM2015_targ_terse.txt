Presence of haustrum and taenia coli in the colon . A) The human colon is divided into different sections (i.e. ascending,
transverse and descending colon) with the presence of taenia coli and
compartmentalization in haustra, which are absent in the mouse colon. E is re-used from  with the
authorâ€™s permission. . For instance, Prevotella abundance
is  known  to  be  low  in  mouse  gut  microbiota  (Hildebrand  et  al., 2011), whereas other genera of this phylum, such as Barnesiella,
Bacteroides and  Alistipes,  significantly  increased  (Zhang  et  al., Overall,  this
highlights  that  the  use  of  diet  intervention  in  murine  models,
including the use of humanized gnotobiotic mice, can mimic the
changes in gut microbiota that occur in relation to human diet..

Bacteroides enterotype, which is associated with animal protein, and
Prevotella enterotype, which links to diets with more carbohydrates
and simple sugars.
