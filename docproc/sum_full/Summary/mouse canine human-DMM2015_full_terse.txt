Table 1. The morphology of mouse and human colons also
differs: the human colon is divided into haustra, whereas the mouse
colon is rather smooth. A reduced ratio
of Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes was also found in a study linking gut
microbiota composition and metabolic adaptations in mice on high-
fat diets (Serino et al., Overall, it has been found that even though gnotobiotic mice are
being  increasingly  used  as  models  for  studying  the  human  gut
microbiota, they might not fully recapitulate the mechanisms of the
human-host–gut-microbiota interaction. Furthermore,  it  was  hypothesized  that  the
differences  between  mice  and  rats  in  recapitulating  the  human
donors’  microbiota  is  due  to  the  intrinsic  differences  in  genetic
backgrounds of the recipient models, which might control for the
establishment of the transferred microbiota (Wos-Oxley et al., More  recently,  another  study  employed  metagenomic
approaches to compare the gut microbiota composition of humans
and guinea pigs (Hildebrand et al.,
