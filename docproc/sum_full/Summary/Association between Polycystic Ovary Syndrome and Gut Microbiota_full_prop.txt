Competing Interests: The authors have declared
that no competing interests exist. Thus, the commensal gut
microbiota also had effects on the production of male sex hormone  It is interesting to
explore the role of gut microbiota in PCOS, as the androgen level in PCOS women always ele-
vated. Administration of probiotics such as Lactobacillus is an attractive
concept in combating various diseases. We hope that our results will shed a new light
on the pathogenesis and treatment for PCOS. Twenty four hours after the last dose of letrozole
(on day 22), PCOS FMT rats were administered a gavage of fecal supernatant with 2×109 fecal
microbiota, PCOS Lactobacillus transplantation rats were administered a gavage of 2×109 Lac-
tobacillus, the control rats and PCOS rats were administered a gavage of normal saline for 14
consecutive days. On day 36, all rat fecal samples were collected for real-time PCR analysis. Trunk blood samples and ovarian tissue samples
were obtained for the subsequent experiments. The specific primers were
showed in S1 Table. This blended fecal mixture was then centrifuged at 1000 g for
5 min, the supernatant was collected and OD value was tested at 620 nm. Statistical analyses

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 15.0 software. Sequence analysis

Seven bands were selected and cut for sequencing in DGGE gels because the mean integrated
optical densities (IOD) of these bands were different between groups. These seven bands were
the top seven bands with the greatest density differences between the control and PCOS group. In
order to verify the resolution capability of DGGE, bands in the same position but in different

P1-P6). C) Principal component analysis (PCA) of fecal microbiota based on DGGE fingerprints. Band 2 and 3 were identified as Prevotella mela-
ninogenica ATCC 25845 with 93% similarity, indicating that the DGGE gel separated V3 16S
rRNA genes from different bacteria effectively. Sequence identities of PCR amplicons derived from DGGE gels. In order to verify the effects of FMT and Lactobacillus transplantation on the composition
of gut microbiota in PCOS rats, PCOS rats were treated with FMT or Lactobacillus and the bac-
teria described above were examined. * p<0.05 results which are signiﬁcantly different versus control group

than that in Lactobacillus transplantation group. FMT and Lactobacillus transplantation improved estrous cycles in
letrozole induced PCOS rats

Using daily vaginal smears, estrous cycles were analyzed for all rats. The granulosa
within the follicles showed multiple layers. Steroid concentrations

The serum estradiol and estrone concentrations were significantly lower in PCOS rats than
those in the control rats. When PCOS rats were treated with FMT or Lactobacillus,
the testosterone and androstenedione levels were decreased significantly compared with those
in PCOS rats (Fig 5C and 5D). et al
found that male germ free mice, unlike females, exhibited a significant high level of 5-hydroxy-
tryptamine and its metabolite in hippocampal compared with conventionally housed control
animals  Collectively, these studies indicated the bi-direction regulation of gut microbiota
and endocrine systems. D) PCOS FMT group
showed increased granulosa layers and formation of corpora lutea. Recently, letrozole-induced PCOS rat model was used in several papers to evaluate
effects of new therapeutic methods for PCOS  which illustrated the recognition of this
