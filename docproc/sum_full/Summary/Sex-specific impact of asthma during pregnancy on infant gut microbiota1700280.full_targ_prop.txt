Female infants are generally born smaller than male infants; however, in response to maternal asthma, the
Caucasian male fetus is more likely to have a lower birthweight and show growth retardation when
delivered at term than the female fetus recently reported less colonisation of stool
with Lactobacillus species at birth and during the first month of life among full-term male infants in
comparison to female infants. Postnatally, depending on the Lactobacillus species, since weight promotion
is species-specific, the dominance of lactobacilli in the infant gut will determine the extent of weight gain
and subsequent atopic disease  Altogether, evidence is mounting for a programming role of
prenatal asthma that might affect the infant gut microbiome. Second, we sought evidence for a fetal programming role of
maternal asthma that was independent of birth mode and related events, and was enhanced by maternal
comorbid conditions, such as overweight and atopic disease..

the species level (figure 1), an unclassified
Finally, using the LEfSe method to test differences at
Lactobacillus species was found to be less abundant in male Caucasian infants born to mothers with atopic
asthma (LDA score 2.93, p<0.05). Both
Megasphaera and Bacteroidaceae microbes produce propionate, but under opposing conditions.
