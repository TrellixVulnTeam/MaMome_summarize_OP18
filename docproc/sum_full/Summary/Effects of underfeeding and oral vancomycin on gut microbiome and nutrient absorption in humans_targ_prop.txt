rial  species  that  were  significantly  different  between  the  two  diet 
arms , including an enrichment 
for A. muciniphila during UF, consistent with our 16S rRNA gene

Lachnospiraceae bacterium 5_1_63FAA. Two bacterial 
species consistently changed in response to both perturbations: A. muciniphila and an unidentified species belonging to Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group..

could explain the increased stool calories loss.
