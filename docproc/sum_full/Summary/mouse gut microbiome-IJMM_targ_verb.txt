number  of  pioneering  studies  have  employed  human-derived
Escherichia  coli  and  Bacteroides  spp. as  model  organisms  to  elucidate
key  principles  of  microbe–host  interactions  in  gnotobiotic  mice. These  bacteria  can  be  genetically  manipulated  and  allow  functional
genetic  analysis. Thus,  the
mutant  only  transiently  colonizes  the  gut  after  which  the  mice. several  fundamental  principles  under-
lying  host–microbe  interactions  have  been  elucidated. Bacteroides
thetaiotaomicron  (B.  theta)  and  Bacteroides  fragilis  are  highly  abun-
dant  and  ubiquitous  obligate  anaerobic  members  of  the  human  gut
microbiota  (Moore  and  Holdeman,  1974;  Qin  et  al., Their
genomes  encode  a  vast  number  of  enzyme  systems  that  mediate
degradation  of  polysaccharides  derived  from  the  diet  and  mucosal
secretions  (Xu  et  al., 2003),  which  shapes  the  mutualistic  relation-
ship  between  Bacteroides  spp. and  their  human  host  (Comstock,
2009). Speciﬁcally,  B.  theta  can  modify  host  epithelial  differen-
tiation  in  a  way  that  supports  its  own   growth:  it  promotes  the
production  of  fucosylated  glycans  by  the  host  and  in  turn  uses
them  as  nutrient  sources  (Bry  et  al., Intriguingly,  this  pro-
cess  is  dependent  on  the  capacity  of  B.  theta  to  utilize  fucose,
reﬂecting  the  mutualistic  nature  of  commensal-host  relationships. B.  fragilis  produces  a  polysaccharide  with  immune  modulatory
activities  (Mazmanian  et  al., 2010,  2013;  Samuel  and  Gordon,  2006). Although  models  harboring  only  few  bacteria  have  been
very  helpful,  care  must  be  taken  when  interpreting  data. In  sim-
pliﬁed  bacterial  communities,  the  context  of  a  fully  diverse  and
competitive  bacterial  ecosystem  is  lacking.
