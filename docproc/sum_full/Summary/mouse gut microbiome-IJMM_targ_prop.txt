number  of  pioneering  studies  have  employed  human-derived
Escherichia  coli  and  Bacteroides  spp. These  bacteria  can  be  genetically  manipulated  and  allow  functional
genetic  analysis. B.  theta  was   shown  to  adapt  to  the  presence  of  Eubac-
terium  rectale  or  the  probiotic  strains  Biﬁdobacterium  longum  and
Lactobacillus  casei  by  expanding  the  breadth  of  its  carbohydrate
utilization  (Mahowald  et  al., Besides  the
species  mentioned  above,  numerous  other  commensal  bacteria
(the  majority  of  which  is  derived  from  humans)  have  been  used
to  interrogate  microbe–host  interactions  in  gnotobiotic  models
(Table  1).
