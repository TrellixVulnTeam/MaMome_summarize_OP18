First we explored in detail the in vitro inhibitory effects of a selection of LGC strains against growth and 
pathogenic properties (adhesion to vaginal cells and hyphae formation) of Candida albicans. When applying the strains simultaneously with C. albi-
cans, the strains were able to reduce adhesion of C. albicans, e.g. L. pentosus KCA1 by 78.0% . Scientific RepoRtS  |         10:7976  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-64705-x

the samples in women who did or did not use RM, the following trend was observed: the women who used RM 
started off with a higher load of fungi and lactobacilli and ended with on average with similar fungal concen-

estimations of absolute abundances of lactobacilli and yeast, the DNA samples obtained before were subjected to 
qPCR analysis, as described previously43. Data availability
