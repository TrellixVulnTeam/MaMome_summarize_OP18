No. Aligned 16S rRNA sequences were selected at the RDP
website and analyzed using the RDP Tree Builder tool. The Classiﬁer engine and related software
were written in Java (API v1.4.1) and have been tested on the Solaris  Linux
 and Microsoft Windows XP operating systems
using Java virtual machines from Sun and Apple. An online version of the Classiﬁer is available at http://rdp.cme.msu.edu
/classiﬁer. A user can submit one sequence or a group of sequences for classiﬁ-
cation. The sequences can be saved in a ﬁle for ﬁle upload or inserted into the
text area on the start page. Users can navigate through
the hierarchy by clicking on the various taxa. Small-subunit rRNA sequences con-
sisting of 5,014 bacterial species type strain sequences in 988 genera (Table 1),
along with associated taxonomic assignment information, were obtained from
Bergey’s Taxonomic Outline of the Prokaryotes (release 5.0   The
sequences averaged 1,460 bases in length and had a range of 1,200 to 1,833 bases. These
sequences are classiﬁed into 1,187 genera in the NCBI taxonomy  Initial
placement into the NCBI taxonomy is based on information provided by the
sequence submitter, with modiﬁcations by the NCBI staff. The position of a word in
a sequence is ignored. As with text-based Bayesian classiﬁers, only those words
occurring in the query contribute to the score  A similar word-based clas-
siﬁcation scheme has been used to search for horizontal gene transfer events in
whole-genome sequences

eight-character subsequences (words). From the corpus consisting of N se-
quences, let n(wi) be the number of sequences containing subsequence wi. The conditional probability that a member of G contains wi was
estimated with the equation P(wi¦G) (cid:2) [m(wi) (cid:1) Pi]/(M (cid:1) 1). Nor-
mally, when data consist of independent features, a bootstrap sample size equal
to the number of features in the original sample is chosen. Classiﬁer accuracy versus bootstrap conﬁdence

a Bootstrap conﬁdence reﬂects the frequency of most common assignments
out of 100 bootstrap samplings. performed based on the default conﬁdence threshold of 80%. Taxa with signiﬁcant differences in representation are
marked. Both comparison results and classiﬁcation
assignments can be downloaded in text format and imported into a spreadsheet
program for further analysis. For each test, we reserved a single
sequence from the corpus as the test sequence and retrained
the Classiﬁer on the remaining sequences. The corpus contained
453 genera represented by single sequences. For these se-
quences, the (obviously) incorrect genus assignment was not
considered in the summary statistics, but the results were in-
cluded for higher ranks containing other genera with valid
training sets . For the near-full-length and 400-base partial rRNA se-
quences, the Classiﬁer was accurate down to the genus level,
while even with 200-base partial sequences, the Classiﬁer was
accurate down to the family level. The strains originally attributed to
Sulfobacillus were both reevaluated in 2005 and reassigned to
the genus Alicyclobacillus, matching the classiﬁcation of the
RDP Classiﬁer but no longer matching the classiﬁcation from
SeqMatch. Pyrosequencing can now produce up to 100 Mb in less than
8 h (Roche product literature). Sogin and colleagues recently
used the ﬁrst version of pyrosequencing, which provided up-
to-100-bp reads, to rapidly analyze large numbers of 16S rRNA
V6 variable regions from environmental samples  In that
study, taxonomic diversity was assessed through alignment to
members of a reference database of vetted V6 sequences. In 2005, S.
thermosulﬁdooxidans strain K1 was reclassiﬁed as the type strain of a
new species, A. tolerans  In our analysis, however, the sequence for
K1 given in the naming paper (accession number AF137502) is 8%
different from that for Z21979. Also, Seq-
Match has been shown to be more accurate than BLAST in
ﬁnding the most similar rRNA sequence as deﬁned by pairwise
aligned distance  The RDP Classiﬁer and RDP SeqMatch
had nearly identical overall error rates. For query sequences from regions of bacterial diversity with
less-deﬁned taxonomy, the RDP Classiﬁer tends to provide
classiﬁcation results with low conﬁdence estimates. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
