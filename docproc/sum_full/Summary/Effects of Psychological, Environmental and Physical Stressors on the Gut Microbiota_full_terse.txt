All body surfaces are colonized by microbes, which oc-
curs through a dynamic process over the ﬁrst few years
of life. Accepted for publication February 12,
2018. Because these cell types can be regulated by
the host microbiome, dysbiosis in the mother could potentially
have indirect effects on the developing neonatal BM in utero by
altering the behavior of these maternally derived progenitors. Nevertheless, recognition of
microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) is likely to be
important; indeed, intestinal colonization of germ-free mice
with a combination of E. coli, Staphylococcus xylosus, and
Enterococcus faecalis stimulates myelopoiesis in a MyD88 and
TRIF–dependent manner  Although it was unclear what
cell types mediated this response, one possibility is that it
reﬂects regulation of secondary mediator production by in-
testinal enterocytes stimulated by MAMPs from the com-
mensal bacteria. 2

Impact of microbial signals on HSC function and leukocyte longevity

The microbial factors that regulate myeloid cell production
and differentiation in the BM may also control their subse-
quent expansion and longevity after their export to the pe-
riphery.
