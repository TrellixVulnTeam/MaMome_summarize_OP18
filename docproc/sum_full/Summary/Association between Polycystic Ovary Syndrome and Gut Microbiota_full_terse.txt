Table 1. et al
found that male germ free mice, unlike females, exhibited a significant high level of 5-hydroxy-
tryptamine and its metabolite in hippocampal compared with conventionally housed control
animals  Collectively, these studies indicated the bi-direction regulation of gut microbiota
and endocrine systems. There is a limi-
tation of our study: ELISA sensitivity can fail to detect low levels of sex steroids and could not
analyze the serum steroids in female rodents according to estrus cycle stage  However, the
available data indicated that sex steroids concentrations could be regulated by microbiota inter-
ventions in PCOS rat model. (DOCX)
