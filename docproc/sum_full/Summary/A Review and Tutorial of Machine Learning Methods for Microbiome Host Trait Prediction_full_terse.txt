of
interplay and use of molecular function descriptors vs. taxonomic
descriptors, the reader is referred to Knights et al. The result is a set of informative features, perhaps including
original OTUs along with higher-level aggregations of taxonomic
features, that can be utilized for downstream machine learning

one continuous) from three datasets with varying sample sizes
