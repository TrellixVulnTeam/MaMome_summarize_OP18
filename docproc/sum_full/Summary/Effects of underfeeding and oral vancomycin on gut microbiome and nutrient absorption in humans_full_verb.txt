Following screening, participants were admitted and placed on a WMD. Collection of food 
(duplicate meals to perform bomb calorimetry) was done on days 5–7 and 11–13. In this two-phase study, 
we directly measured stool and ingested calories along with plasma 
biomarkers  of  host  and  microbial  metabolism  during  overfeeding 
(OF) and UF (phase I) and then in a randomized, double-blind, pla-
cebo-controlled trial with oral vancomycin versus placebo (phase II). As  expected,  the  absolute  number  of  calories  lost  per  day 
was significantly higher in overfed relative to underfed individuals 
(257.4 ± 91.2 kcal d−1 versus 123.5 ± 32.4 kcal d−1, Δ = 139.4 kcal d−1,

determined by two-sided paired Student’s t-test. Participants who started the dietary phase with OF are represented by red dots, while those who started 
with UF are represented by white dots. The transit time was defined as the time between the first and the last appearance of the dye marker during each 
intervention, in hours. When analyzed within each subject, we were 
able to identify two individuals (of ten evaluated) that had signifi-
cant differences in overall microbial community structure between 
diet arms , which may suggest that the baseline gut micro-
biota matters for its sensitivity to the dietary interventions. There  were  no  significant  differences

In  this  two-phase  study  we  directly  measured  ingested  and  stool 
calories, demonstrating an increased and comparable stool calorie 
loss relative to ingested calories during two states: UF versus OF and 
oral vancomycin versus placebo. Subjects are split by diet order (n = 11 OF → UF and n = 9 UF → OF). c, First

that  did  not  find  an  effect  of  oral  vancomycin  on  stool  calories 
despite widespread changes in gut microbial community structure 
and  metabolite  concentrations. Received: 15 February 2019; Accepted: 13 February 2020;
