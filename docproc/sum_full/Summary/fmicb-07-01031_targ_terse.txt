In this review, we describe the pronounced microbial

female, as well as
in the pregnant
provide an overview of the initial exposure of the fetus to
microbiota—from the placenta,
through birth and infancy. This strengthens the fact that more studies are needed to
understand the eﬀects of pregnancy on the gut microbiota..

As in the gut, the vaginal microbiome undergoes signiﬁcant
changes during pregnancy, including a signiﬁcant decrease in
overall diversity, increased stability (the community composition
changes over time), and enrichment with Lactobacillus species
(Aagaard et al., Alternatively, it was suggested that
hematogenous spread of oral microbes to the placenta might be
a driver of preterm birth (Aagaard et al., However, direct proof for microbial colonization of the
fetus, as well as the potential mechanisms by which bacteria pass
from the mother to the fetus are still unknown. Interestingly, high levels of S. aureus are also
found in the gut microbiota of overweight children; however,
the source of this bacterium is, as yet, unclear (Kalliomaki et al., Breast milk contains oligosaccharides, complex
carbohydrates that cannot be digested by the infant.
