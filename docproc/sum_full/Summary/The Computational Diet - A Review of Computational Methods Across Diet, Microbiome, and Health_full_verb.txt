established gut microbiota such as Crohn’s disease (Manichanh

and research hypothesis, diﬀerent information dimensionalities
are used, such as gene-level (Vatanen et al., The most widely used approach for gut microbiota

Eetemadi et al. Today,
limited microbiome studies perform such analysis (Blekhman
et al., 2016)
UPARSE-OTU(U) (Edgar, 2013),
Kraken (Wood and Salzberg, 2014),
MetaPhlAn2(Q) (Truong et al., Data Analytics and Machine Learning
Data processing is considered to be the step necessary for
converting the raw data, such as metagenomics sequence reads,
into biologically meaningful representations, such as OTU counts
using bioinformatics tools, some of which are done in the
sequencing device itself. Although several pipelines provide this functionality,
it has been found inadmissible for metagenomics microbiome
studies as it discards many reads leading to decreased sensitivity
in diﬀerential abundance testing (McMurdie and Holmes, 2014)
and biased estimates for alpha diversity (Willis, 2019). Computational Diet, Microbiome and Health

TABLE 3 | Key challenges that arise in microbiome data analysis with examples and suggested solutions. Therefore, common statistical
techniques that assume independence between variables
are problematic. Solutions: (I) Convert read counts to relative abundances before comparison. ( Solution: Use phylogeny-aware metrics such as UniFrac distance instead, which takes into
account the phylogenetic tree when calculating distances. Example: In one case, metagenomic data processing from marker-gene data has provided us with
relative abundances at the genus level, but we do not know the possible functions of the microbiota
in terms of proteins that it can produce. More advanced methods include

for

semi-supervised learning (Zhu, 2005), which takes advantage of
both labeled and unlabeled data, and transfer learning (Pan and
Yang, 2010), which transfers knowledge learned from one task to
another, are not discussed here. Classiﬁcation
In supervised classiﬁcation, the goal is to build a predictive
model (classiﬁer) using labeled training data. In a diﬀerent
study, the classiﬁcation task was to identify healthy vs. unhealthy
donors given relative OTU abundance data (including species
level) coming from shotgun metagenomics sequencing of the gut
(as well as other body sites) (Pasolli et al., For example, in L1 regularization, the
absolute values of model parameters are scaled and added to
the loss function. Multiple factor analysis (MFA)
is an extension of PCA that considers predeﬁned grouping of
features during DR to ensure equal representation for all groups

of features in derived PCs (Abdi et al., Unlike PCA and PCoA, it requires class labels. Once a similarity
measure is deﬁned, various cluster analysis methods can be
used to ﬁnd groups of samples with similar microbiota. 2018; Bauer and Thiele,
2018; Greenhalgh et al., See Magnúsdóttir and Thiele for a
comprehensive review. The ﬁrst challenge is the limited availability and accuracy of
GENREs for gut microbes. When a group of users (or items) are overrepresented in the
data, the predictive model tends to be biased toward their
favorite items. The
second challenge is the curse of dimensionality. In scenario B, the goal is to provide
recommended probiotic intake for supporting a healthy gut
