Probiotics might be a safe and effective alternative to
antibiotics in restoring the imbalance of the vaginal micro-
biota found in BV. Sequences were clus-

tered into operational
sequence dissimilarity distance of 0.015 using an average
neighbour algorithm and then classiﬁed using a Na€ıve
Bayesian classiﬁer implemented in mothur with the Human
Oral Microbiome Database release 14.51 reference dataset. Prior to this
trial, a qualitative study was conducted to obtain input
from women.32 The available core outcome set for PTB33
had an inﬂuence on data collected. We used probiotics that are safe during pregnancy
and have been reported to colonise the vagina in some
non-pregnant women within 2 weeks of treatment.19 Before
the start of the study, we conﬁrmed the viability of the lac-
tobacilli in the probiotic capsules and that our laboratory
techniques would detect them in culture. BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of
