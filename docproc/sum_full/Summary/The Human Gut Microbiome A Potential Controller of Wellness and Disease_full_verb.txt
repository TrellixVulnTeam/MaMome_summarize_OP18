Gut Microbiome in Human Health

INTRODUCTION

The human microbiome comprises of collective genomes of
microbiota inhabiting us, namely protozoa, archaea, eukaryotes,
viruses and predominantly bacteria that live symbiotically on and
within various sites of the human body. Examples of occupied
habitats include our oral cavity, genital organs, respiratory tract,
skin and gastrointestinal system (Lloyd-Price et al., The
human microbiota is estimated to be ∼1013–1014 microbial
cells, with around 1:1 microbial cells to human cells ratio
(Sender et al., These numbers are derived from the
total bacterial cells in colon  the organ
that harbors the densest number of microbes (Sender et al., The diverse gastrointestinal microbiota is predominantly
composed of bacteria from three major phyla, namely Firmicutes,
Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria (Tap et al., Until recent decades, the
properties of the human microbiome and the host–microbiota
interactions have been largely unknown due to technology
limitations especially in examining non-cultivable microbes
of interest, and lack of population-scale data depicting the
microbiota compositions and functions. Several analyses have been incorporated in these meta-omics
projects including 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing to
taxonomically characterize the microbiota communities; Whole
Genome Shotgun (WGS) metagenomic sequencing of body-site
speciﬁc whole community DNA, followed by reference genome
mapping, metagenomic assembly, gene cataloging and metabolic
reconstruction, to facilitate maximal capture of organismal and
functional data of human microbiota (The Human Microbiome
Project Consortium, 2012). Robust experimental modeling enables
systematic manipulation of variables to investigate hypotheses
deduced from “omics” studies. For this, the application of
‘humanized’ gnotobiotic animal model that harbors deﬁned
collection of sequenced microbial communities, has gained
momentum in recent years in microbiome research (Faith
et al., This allows proof-of-mechanism study to examine
the potential

antibiotic, environmental toxicants (Stedtfeld et al., 2017) and
host genotypic variation (Ley et al., impacts of diet

shed light on the clinical
signiﬁcance of the human microbiome which is pretty much a
‘black box.’ Metabolism
Human fecal
sample analysis using 16S ribosomal RNA
and metagenomic sequencing techniques reveal signiﬁcant
enrichment in metabolism of polysaccharides, amino acids,
xenobiotics and micronutrients conferred by gut microbiota,
suggest that these indigenous microbes facilitate host energy
harvesting and metabolic eﬃciency (Gill et al., These
ﬁndings were further validated by germ-free (GF) mice
experiments where it was found that germ-free mice had
40% lower epididymal
fat and an additional 10–30% food
consumption was needed to maintain the same body mass as mice
with normal microbiota (Backhed et al., Gut microbiota is
important in fermenting unabsorbed starch and soluble dietary
ﬁber. The fermented end products exist in the form of a SCFAs. 1998) thereby contributing an extra 10% daily dietary energy
for utilization by the host for other metabolic processes (Payne
et al., Microbial-synthesized SCFAs contribute 70% of
ATP production in colon, with butyrate as the preferred fuel
for colonocytes (Firmansyah et al., Vitamin-K-producing gut bacteria
namely Bacteroides fragilis, Eubacterium lentum, Enterobacter
agglomerans, Serratia marcescens, and Enterococcus faecium
(Fernandez and Collins, 1987; Cooke et al., 2006) anaerobically
synthesize vitamin K2 (menaquinone) which is essential
in
decreasing vascular calciﬁcation, elevating HDL and lowering
cholesterol levels, contributing to lower risk of cardiovascular
disorders such as atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease
(Kawashima et al., In humans, 95% of bile
acids are reabsorbed at distal ileum (Staels and Fonseca, 2009). The 5% unabsorbed primary bile acids are then bioconverted
or deconjugated to secondary bile acids
(predominantly
DCA and LCA) by bile salt hydrolases secreted by several
and
colonic microbiota
Clostridium scindens, followed by partly colonic reabsorption
and transportation back to liver for conjugation (Gopal-
Srivastava and Hylemon, 1988; Ajouz et al., Such GPCR
activation will stimulate second messenger c-AMP production,
and the subsequent c-AMP-dependent downstream signaling,
inducing expressions of a multitude of genes, whereby its
physiological importance remains to be fully elucidated, pointing
toward impacts of secondary bile acid-TCR5 axis (Hylemon
et al., Such antimicrobial
