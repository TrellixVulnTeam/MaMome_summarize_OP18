First we explored in detail the in vitro inhibitory effects of a selection of LGC strains against growth and 
pathogenic properties (adhesion to vaginal cells and hyphae formation) of Candida albicans. We examined the vaginal microbiome over four weeks: before, during, and after the 
use of the probiotic gel and compared the group requiring rescue medication (RM; 3 × 200 mg fluconazole) with 
the group not requesting this antifungal treatment. Results
In vitro selection of LGc strains for anti-Candida effects. In the spot assay, it yielded the largest inhibition zones and its cell 
free supernatant reduced the optical density at stationary planktonic growth of C. albicans by 43.5% and delayed 
the lag phase by approximately 5 hours (Supplementary Fig. The lactobacilli with the strongest antimicrobial effects showed adhesive capacities of 11.3% (L. plantarum 
WCFS1), 11.8% (L. rhamnosus GG) and 34.7% (L. pentosus KCA1)  to vaginal keratinocyte cell line 
(VK2/E6E7), used as model for the vaginal epithelium. When applying the strains simultaneously with C. albi-
cans, the strains were able to reduce adhesion of C. albicans, e.g. L. pentosus KCA1 by 78.0% . Subsequently, we evaluated whether L. plantarum 
WCFS1, L. pentosus KCA1 and L. rhamnosus GG formulated in the gel were able to modulate the vaginal micro-
biome over a four-week period in 20 patients suffering from acute VVC . The participants were asked to 
administer 2.5 ml of gel by use of an applicator in recumbent position at bedtime. The qPCR results 
showed that in general the estimated absolute fungal abundances were significantly lower for these visits (visit 
3 mean=7.4.103 CFU/ml and visit 4 mean=5.7.102 CFU/ml) as compared to visit 1 (mean = 1.1.105 CFU/ml, 
p = 0.005 and p = 0.0002 respectively, visit 2 mean = 3.8.104 CFU/ml, visit 2 vs. 4 p = 0.0009; Fig. The regular growth medium without 
any added microorganisms was used as a negative control. ( Data on medical history and patient satisfaction was collected 
through questionnaires at the intake visit and study termination (visit 4). Significant 
differences were tested with pairwise Wilcoxon tests and significance levels are indicated when p < 0.05. Scientific RepoRtS  |         10:7976  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-64705-x

both, which were supplemented in the gel, as this ASV was only found at visit 2 (16/20 samples, during treatment 
with the gel) and visit 3  Similarly, LGC 7, found in 12 of the 20 visit 2 samples and one visit 3 
sample, likely corresponded to L. rhamnosus GG, also supplemented in the gel. One visit 4 sample could not be analyzed because of insufficient sequencing
