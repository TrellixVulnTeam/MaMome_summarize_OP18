All pregnant women routinely performed an oral glucose tolerance test at 24–28 gestational
weeks at the “Città della Salute e della Scienza” Hospital of Turin. The first 50 consecutive sub-
jects who met both the criteria for GDM according to international guidelines (fasting plasma
glucose �92 mg/dL and/or 1h post-test glycemia �180 mg/dL and/or 2h post-test glycemia
�153 mg/dL) and the inclusion criteria (see below) were enrolled [17]. Out of them, 41
women participated in an observational study aiming to evaluate the changes in gut micro-
biota composition across pregnancy [17]. The fecal samples of their offspring were collected in
the first week of life. Indeed, as the mode of collection and/or storage of the offspring stool
samples by 12 mothers resulted inappropriate, data of 29 infants (70.7%) could be analyzed
only (S1 Table). Inclusion criteria were: GDM diagnosed by a 75g oral glucose tolerance test
(OGTT) between 24–28 weeks gestational age and European origin with both parents born in
Europe. Women with twin pregnancy, any pathological conditions before or during pregnancy
(known diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular, pulmonary, autoimmune, joint, liver
or kidney diseases, thyroid dysfunction, cancer, any other disease/condition), no compliance
to the study protocol, on prebiotics/probiotics, antibiotics or any drug during pregnancy were
excluded. All the GDM patients received dietary counselling and the recommendation of per-
forming 30-min daily moderate exercise (i.e. brisk walking) and were instructed to self-moni-
tor finger-prick capillary blood glucose at least 4 times per day. Participants completed a 3-day
food record (2 weekdays and 1 weekend day) and the Minnesota-Leisure-Time-Physical Activ-
ity Questionnaire at enrolment and at the study end [17]. Detailed information on how to
record the food and drink consumed by using common household measures was provided to
all participants. Two dieticians checked all questionnaires for completeness, internal coherence
and plausibility [17].
Total DNA from the feces collected was extracted using the RNeasy Power Microbiome KIT
(Qiagen, Milan, Italy) following the manufacturer’s instructions. One microliter of RNase
(Illumina Inc. San Diego. CA) was added to digest RNA in the DNA samples, with an incuba-
tion of 1 h at 37 ˚C. DNA was quantified using the QUBIT dsDNA Assay kit (Life Technolo-
gies, Milan, Italy) and standardized at 5 ng/μL. DNA was used as a template in a PCR reaction
in order to amplify the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene [29]. Library preparation and
sequencing (2X250bp) was performed as already reported [17].
Blautia, Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium were extracted and entropy analysis and oligotyping
were carried out [31] since these were the only OTUs showing higher level of entropy able to
obtain sub-OTUs. After the first round of oligotyping, high entropy positions were chosen (-C
option): 8, 12, 113, 223, 224, 247, 432, 433 for Blautia; position 8, 12, 40, 74, 75, 116, 117, 124,
129, 130, 390, 397, 452 and 453 were chosen for Bacteroides; while position 8, 12, 14, 81, 114,
115, 158, 159, 160, 328, 329, 389, 437, 438, 439, 440, 441, 442, 443 and 444 were chosen for Bifi-
dobacterium. In order to reduce the noise, each oligotype should appear in at least 10 samples,
occur in more than 1.0% of the reads for at least ten samples, represent a minimum of 750
reads in all samples combined, and have a most abundant unique sequence with a minimum
abundance of 50. A cladogram of representative sequences was generated using the ANVIOs
software [32].
Gut microbiota α-diversity was calculated by the diversity function of the vegan package [33]
in R environment (  ADONIS and ANOSIM statistical test were used
to detect significant differences in the overall microbial community by using the unweighted
UniFrac distance matrices or OTU table. Offspring variables were compared with maternal
variables by paired-sample t-test, or Wilcoxon matched pairs test, as appropriate. Differences
in infant gut microbiota between mothers who were compliant or not to the dietary recom-
mendations, or between the GDM offspring and healthy-women offspring were calculated by
t-Student test or Mann-Whitney test. Pairwise Spearman’s non-parametric correlations were
used to study the relationships between the infant relative abundance of microbial taxa and
maternal dietary and metabolic variables. The degree of agreement (concordance) among
maternal oligotypes at enrolment, maternal oligotypes at the study-end and infant oligotypes
was assessed by the Friedman ANOVA & Kendall’s test.
The post-hoc power estimated on partial R2 according to the multivariate linear regression
model adjusted for maternal weight change, breastfeeding and Cesarean section was 0.80 with
α = 0.05. A P value of 0.002 or lower was considered as statistically significant.
while saturated fatty acids (SFA) derived mainly from meat and cheese. In a multiple regres-
sion model, after adjusting for weight change, breastfeeding and Cesarean section, associations
between infant Ruminococcus with maternal oligosaccharide (positive association) and with
maternal intake of SFA (inverse association) were found, even if not reaching the defined
cutoff of p-values. The inverse relationship between Rikenellaceae and maternal SFA intake
remained statistically significant (Table 1). In the multivariate model, no significant associa-
tion between infant gut microbiota and maternal dietary habits at the study-end was found.
The direct association between maternal fasting glucose at enrolment and Enterococcus
(Rho = 0.49) was no longer confirmed in the multivariate model, while the inverse association
between Clostridiales and maternal changes across pregnancy (delta) in glycated hemoglobin
(HbA1c) levels was statistically significant (Table 1). No significant association between mater-
nal anthropometric or metabolic variables and the gestational changes in these variables and
infant gut microbiota composition was found. Two out of 29 women were treated with insulin;
none received metformin. After adjusting for insulin treatment, the results of the multiple
regression analyses did not change.

Ten out of the 29 (34.5%) newborns were breastfed by their mothers, while 19 (65.5%)
were formula-fed. We observed a non-significant reduction in microbial richness in breastfed
infants when compared to infants fed with artificial milk.
At phylum level, we observed that breastfed infants showed a higher abundance of Actino-
bacteria and Proteobacteria, while in formula-fed infants we observed a higher proportion of
Firmicutes phyla (Fig 5A). At genus level, breastfed infants displayed an increased abundance
of Escherichia and Bifidobacterium, while formula-fed infants had a varied microbiota mainly
composed of Bacteroides, Clostridium, Enterococcaceae, Escherichia, Faecalibacterium, Staphy-
lococcus and Streptococcus (Fig 5B). In multiple regression analyses, a significant association
between breastfeeding and the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium in the infant gut micro-
biota was found (β = 22.9; 95%CI = 10.1–35.7; P = 0.0017).
In order to explore the possible mother-to-infant gut microbiota transmission at sub-OTUs
level, we carried out oligotyping on sequences of Blautia, Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium
since these were the only genera showing a Shannon entropy index sufficient to identify all
abundance of the Blautia oligotypes increased during the pregnancy and were lower in the
infants (S4A Fig). A high degree of mother-offspring concordance was found for B11
(P = 0.008) and B42 (P<0.001); both were identified as Blautia wexlerae by best BLASTn
match. A reduction in the relative abundance of Bacteroides oligotypes was observed across
pregnancy while few oligotypes were observed to be dominant in the offspring samples
(S4B Fig).
The gut microbiota of our offspring was compared with those of 19 breastfed infants from
healthy normoglycemic women. A higher α-diversity was evident in the latter (for the Chao-1
diversity index, P = 0.001). However, when comparing to those infants the 10 breastfed infants
from GDM women, no significant difference in α-diversity was found. At phylum level, we
observed higher abundance of Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes in the offspring from GDM
women (S5A Fig) (P<0.001). At genus level, higher abundance of Staphylococcus, Ralstonia,
Lactobacillus and some members of Enterobacteriaceae were observed in the offspring from
healthy women (S5B Fig).
Several limitations of the present study should be recognized. The sample size was low,
the standard errors were wide, and we could analyze the fecal samples of only 70.7% of the
offspring of the initially enrolled women. Therefore, we might not have detected modest differ-
ences in bacterial composition. Many associations that we found to be not statistically signifi-
cant, could have become so if we had analyzed a larger sample. However, the post-hoc power
was 0.80 with α = 0.05; furthermore, we have set-up a lower p-value cut-off value (p<0.002) as
statistically significant. In doing so, we have considered only the strongest associations; how-
ever, we cannot exclude the possibility that a type II error could have occurred.
