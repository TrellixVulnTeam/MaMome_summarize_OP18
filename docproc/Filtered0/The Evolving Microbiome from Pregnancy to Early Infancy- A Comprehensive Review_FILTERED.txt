Abstract: Pregnancy induces a number of immunological, hormonal, and metabolic changes that are
necessary for the mother to adapt her body to this new physiological situation. The microbiome of
the mother, the placenta and the fetus inﬂuence the fetus growth and undoubtedly plays a major
role in the adequate development of the newborn infant. Hence, the microbiome modulates the
inﬂammatory mechanisms related to physiological and pathological processes that are involved in
the perinatal progress through diﬀerent mechanisms. The present review summarizes the actual
knowledge related to physiological changes in the microbiota occurring in the mother, the fetus,
and the child, both during neonatal period and beyond. In addition, we approach some speciﬁc
pathological situations during the perinatal periods, as well as the inﬂuence of the type of delivery
and feeding.
Pregnancy induces a number of immunological, hormonal, and metabolic changes necessary for the
normal development of the fetus and for a timely onset of labor and successful delivery [1]. It has been
described that maternal microbiota inﬂuences prenatal and early postnatal oﬀspring development and
health outcomes [2,3]. There is a lack of consensus about the real nature of microbiome changes during
pregnancy, since discrepant and unpredictable ﬁndings have been described [4–6]. These diﬀerences
could be explained by the diﬀerence in gestational age, genetics, ethnicity, and environmental factors
surrounding the participants included in those studies. Indeed, it has been described that maternal
microbiota composition during pregnancy is related to maternal diet [7–9], and by pre-pregnancy
weight and weight gain over the course of pregnancy [10–13]. Koren et al. described that the amounts
of anti-inﬂammatory butyrate-producer commensal bacteria present in non-pregnant women gut
microbiota decrease while bacteria associated with pro-inﬂammatory responses, such as Proteobacteria,
increase during pregnancy [4]. Similarly, bacterial diversity tends to be reduced in vaginal microbiota
during pregnancy while increasing vaginal Streptococci along with several speciﬁc Lactobacilli strains,
which are thought to prevent the growth of pathogenic bacteria, as well as to help human digestion,
and inﬂuence host innate and adaptive immune system responses [4,14]. Furthermore, the classical
paradigm of the fetus as a sterile organism is under discussion, since a characteristic microbiome has
been identiﬁed in the placenta, the amniotic ﬂuid, and the fetus in healthy pregnancies [15,16]. However,
this issue is under discussion. Perez-Muñoz et al. argued the weakness of evidence supporting the
The gut microbiota shifts substantially throughout the progression of the pregnancy and is
characterized by reduced individual richness (alpha-diversity) (Figure 1), and increased inter-subject
beta-diversity [4]. These changes are not related to, although they may be inﬂuenced by, the diet,
antibiotic treatments, gestational diabetes, or pre-pregnancy body mass index, but are vital for a healthy
pregnancy [4]. It has been suggested that other factors, such as the state of the host immune and
endocrine systems, may actively contribute to the observed modiﬁcations [24]. During the ﬁrst
trimester, the gut microbiota pattern is similar in many aspects to that of healthy non-pregnant women,
showing a predominance of Firmicutes, mainly Clostridiales, over Bacteroidetes [25]. Then, maternal
gut microbiota declines in butyrate-producing bacteria, while Biﬁdobacteria, Proteobacteria, and lactic
acid-producing bacteria increase from the ﬁrst to the third trimester, when the microbiota resembles
an unpredictably disease-associated dysbiosis that diﬀers greatly among normal pregnancies [4].
Changes in the host immune system of the gastrointestinal mucosa together with metabolic hormonal
changes may trigger a low-grade pro-inﬂammatory status that could facilitate an increased diﬀusion
of glucose from the gut epithelium towards the lumen, and thus may induce weight gain while
modifying the gut microbiota during normal pregnancies [26]. Indeed, changes in the microbiota
may contribute to the evolution of this process. In addition, disruption of maternal gut microbiota
during the third trimester [27] may aﬀect host metabolism in order to provide an energy supply for
the fetus [4,26]. Moreover, it has been reported that the gut microbiota during pregnancy is a critical

However, the relationship among the immune system, the gut microbiota, and metabolism in pregnancy is unclear, and more research is needed to stablish final conclusions.   Figure 1. Alpha-diversity changes in gut microbiota during pregnancy. 2.2. Vaginal Microbiota The composition of the vaginal microbiota is dynamic, corresponding with hormonal fluctuations throughout the woman's reproductive life, and also during pregnancy. A number of protective lactic acid-producing Lactobacillus species dominates the healthy vaginal microbiota in most reproductive-age women. These bacteria protect against vaginal dysbiosis and inhibit opportunistic infections through the direct and indirect protective effects of Lactobacillus products, such as lactic acid and bacteriocin among others. Lactic acid decreases vaginal pH and thus inhibits a broad range of infections [29], can directly affect host immune functions, by inhibiting pro-inflammatory responses, and also help to release mediators from vaginal epithelial cells and stimulate antiviral response [30]. In addition, Lactobacillus-derived bacteriocins may inhibit pathogen growth [31]. The degree of protection varies according to the predominant Lactobacillus specie [30]. Vaginal dysbiosis is comprised of a wide array of strict and facultative anaerobes that correlate to increased risk of infection, diseases, and poor reproductive and obstetric outcomes [32].  During normal pregnancy, the composition of the vaginal microbiota changes as a function of gestational age, with an increase in the relative abundance for Lactobacillus spp., such as L. crispatus, L. jensenii, L. gasserii, L. vaginalis, and a decrease in anaerobe or strict anaerobe microbial species, such as Atopobium, Prevotella, Sneathia, Gardenerella, Ruminococcaceae, Parvimonas, Mobilincus [33]. Those authors reported for the first time, that the composition and stability of the vaginal microbiota of normal pregnant women is different from that of non-pregnant women. In fact, low risk pregnant women have more stable vaginal flora throughout the pregnancy than non-pregnant women. Normal changes in the vaginal flora during pregnancy are transitions to another Lactobacillus community, and this stability would protect against ascending infections through the genital tract. In addition, they reported that Lactobacillus communities vary depending on the ethnicity of the women [33]. Stout et al. [34] confirmed that vaginal microbiota richness and diversity remained stable during the first and second trimesters of gestation in pregnancies ended at term, whereas in woman with preterm born, the richness and diversity decreased early in pregnancy. Therefore, early pregnancy may be an important environment, modulating preterm delivery. A meta-analysis reported significant diversity differences in vaginal microbiomes in the first trimester, between women with term and preterm outcomes, indicating a potential diagnostic utility of microbiome-related biomarkers [35]. In addition, the increase of pathogens in the vagina is associated with complications of pregnancy, in particular with an increased risk of preterm birth and spontaneous abortion [6].    Nutrients 2020, 12, 133
An increase in the microbial load in the oral cavity during pregnancy has been described. It has
been hypothesized that pregnancy creates a nutrient environment that is more favorable to some
sensitive strains [36]. The presence of pathogenic bacteria Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter
actinomycotemcomitans in gingival sulcus were signiﬁcantly higher during early and middle stages
of pregnancy compared to non-pregnant women [37]. The oral alpha-diversity index was higher
in the third trimester compared to non-pregnant women, and this may be related to the increase of
progesterone and estradiol. [38]. One underlying mechanism refers to estrogens being substituted
for vitamin K in bacterial anaerobic respiration, especially for black-pigmented Bacteroides such as
Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Prevotella intermedia [38].
The classical paradigm of fetal environment as a sterile harbor has traditionally explained that
microbes, and thus microbiome, are acquired both vertically (from the mother) and horizontally (from
other humans or from the environment) during and after birth. However, recent data have questioned
the traditional accepted dogma of human microbiome acquisition, proposing that neither the placenta,
the amniotic ﬂuid, nor the fetus are sterile.
However, it is unclear where the fetal microbiota comes from, and when is the ﬁrst fetal exposition.
The presence of a diﬀerent placental microbiota compared to the vagina raises the possibility that
the infant may be ﬁrst seeded in utero from other sources. Microorganism may pass through the
placenta and colonize the fetus ascending from the vagina, from the oral cavity, from the urinary track,
or from the intestinal lumen of the mother. These microorganisms may reach via the hematogenous
route, the placenta, and then be transmitted to the fetus [48]. Some of those oral bacteria, such as
Fusobacterium nucleatum, may be transmitted hematogenously during placentation by binding to
the vascular endothelium, and modifying its permeability and the translation of other common
commensals, such as Escherichia coli [49]. In addition, Franasiak et al. observed that Flavobacterium and
Lactobacillus represent the majority of endometrial bacterium at the time of embryo transfer, supporting
a new hypothesis of the endometrial environment participation [50].
There is great controversy in the scientiﬁc community about the relationship of the meconium
and infant gut microbiota proﬁle, and the type of delivery. Microbiome studies on early infancy
have demonstrated a signiﬁcant inﬂuence of the mode of delivery on the microbiome composition,
suggesting the likely association of the infant gut bacteria with maternal vaginal or skin microbiome
habitats. A systematic review has concluded that the diversity and colonization pattern of the gut
microbiota were signiﬁcantly associated to the mode of delivery during the ﬁrst three months of
life, which is a critical period of life for immunological programming [55]. However, the observed
diﬀerences disappear after 6 months of infants’ life, when solid foods are included in the diet [56].
It is important to clarify the inﬂuence of factors commonly accompanying C-section delivery on the
microbiome, due to the potential inﬂuence on some non-communicable diseases, such as neonatal skin
infection, asthma, allergies, obesity, inﬂammatory bowel disease, or type I diabetes mellitus [56,57].
Vaginally delivered newborn have shown bacterial communities resembling their own mother’s
vaginal microbiota, dominated by Lactobacillus, Prevotella, or Sneathia spp. In contrast, C-section-born
infants harbored bacterial communities similar to those found on the skin surface niche, dominated by
Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, and Propionibacterium spp. [58] or potentially pathogenic microbial
communities such as Klebsiella, Enterococcus, and Clostridium [57]. Other authors have reported that
Biﬁdobacterium [59] and Bacteroides [55] seem to be signiﬁcantly more frequent in vaginally compared
with C-section delivered infants, which were mainly colonized by Clostridium and Lactobacillus [55].
The high abundance of Biﬁdobacterium species in infants is considered to promote the maturation
of the healthy immune system, while high presence of Clostridium diﬃcile is considered as one of
the major intra-hospital hazards of severe gastrointestinal infections during infancy [55]. Another
study proposed that some species of Propionibacterium were most abundant in the meconium of
vaginally delivered Chinese infants, whereas C-section-born children had higher amounts of Bacillus
licheniformis.
In addition, the diversity of the microbial composition was also higher in vaginal
than in C-section deliveries, although no correlation with maternal microbiome was reported [60].
Similarly, a metagenomic analysis found a Propionibacterium-enriched meconium in vaginal delivery
mothers, which may proceed from skin or fecal microbes through direct contact during the natural
labor [61]. Therefore, there is no consensus regarding the most colonizable pattern of the ﬁrst
microbiota community in the ﬁrst three days after birth, although it seems that according to phyla,
vaginal deliveries are more related to Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes, while C-section deliveries are
more related to Firmicutes. In addition, it has also been suggested that the transfer of maternal vaginal
microbes plays a minor role in seeding infant stool microbiota since the overlap of maternal vaginal
microbiota and infant faecal microbiota is minimal, while the similarity between maternal rectal
microbiota and infant microbiota was more pronounced [62].
Furthermore, bacterial richness and diversity were lower in the infant gut of babies born after
elective C-section and higher in emergency C-section, suggesting that colonization may be aﬀected
diﬀerently in both situations. It is important to highlight that emergency C-section and vaginal delivery
labor are frequently accompanied by rupture of fetal membranes, and exposing the fetus to maternal
vaginal bacteria [65].
Some studies have compared the fetal and mother microbiome in relation to adverse outcomes
such as prematurity or low birth-weight without reaching ﬁrm conclusions. Ardissone et al. [91]
compared the meconium microbiome in newborn before and after 33 weeks of gestation and concluded
that Enterococcus and Enterobacter negatively correlated with gestational age, and Lactobacillus and
Phortorhabdus were more abundant in newborns with less than 33 weeks of gestation. They indicated
that the composition of the microbiome may be involved in the inﬂammatory response that
leads to premature birth more than the colonization alone. Speciﬁcally, preterm subjects with
severe chorioamnionitis had higher abundance of Ureaplasma parvum, Fusobacterium nucleatum,
and Streptococcus agalactiae [16]. The placental microbiome varies as a consequence of an excess
of gestational weight gain, but is not related to obesity among women with spontaneous preterm
birth. Indeed, this placental dysbiosis aﬀects diﬀerent bacterially encoded metabolic pathways that
may be related to pregnancy outcomes [92]. Furthermore, it has been reported high abundance of
Burkholderia, Actinomycetales, and Alphaproteobacteria in placental samples from gravidae delivered
preterm, and of Streptococcus and Acinetobacter in placental samples from patients with a history of
antepartum urinary infection. In contrast, Paenibacillus predominated in term placental specimens [15].
Other authors have proposed that the fetal intestinal microbiota derives from swallowed amniotic ﬂuid,
and that they may trigger an inﬂammatory response which leads to premature birth [91]. Considering
that some Lactobacillus strains may possess potential anti-inﬂammatory activities, and could regulate
blood glucose levels in diabetic humans [93], the low abundance of Lactobacillus in placentas of low
birth weight neonates reported by Zheng et al. [94] might be related to a pro-inﬂammatory status in
these pregnancies. Thus, the higher sensitivity of fetal intestinal tissue to inﬂammatory stimuli may
induce labor due to an immune-mediated reaction. However, as mentioned previously, the presence
of placental microbiota is under discussion due to methodological doubts, and these data have to be
discussed with caution.
Finally, a number of bacteria, viruses, and protozoa infections have been associated with pregnancy
complications. Liu et al [95] analyzed the gut microbiome in pregnant women aﬀected by preeclampsia.
They showed an overall increase in pathogenic bacteria such as Clostridium perfringens and Bulleidia
moorei and a reduction in probiotic bacteria Coprococcus catus. A correlation between periodontitis and
the risk of spontaneous abortion or miscarriage has also been described [96]. More well-controlled
studies should be carried out in order to identify interactions between pregnancy microbiome and
mother and children health which might help to predict gestational and newborn complications and
search for new therapeutic targets in adverse obstetrical conditions.
Epidemiological evidence shows that 50% of women in childbearing age and 20%–25% of pregnant
women in Europe can be aﬀected by overweight or obesity [97], increasing the cardiometabolic risk in
mothers [98] and the susceptibility to metabolic diseases in oﬀspring [99–102]. Pregnancy-associated
changes are diﬀerent in overweight or obese women compared to normal-weight pregnant women.
Overweight pregnant women show a reduction in the number of Biﬁdobacterium and Bacteroides,
and an increase in the number of Staphylococcus, Enterobacteriaceae, and Escherichia coli [11]. Additionally,
higher levels of Staphylococcus and Akkermansia muciniphila, and lower levels of Biﬁdobacterium were
detected in women with excessive weight gain during pregnancy as compared to normal-weight
ones [76]. Consequently, this altered maternal microbiome will contribute to shape an altered
composition of the oﬀspring’s microbiome [103,104] and thus inﬂuence their future health.
In addition to the critical patients, associated dysbiosis, hypoperfusion, and reperfusion of the
intestinal wall produce an intense inﬂammation of the digestive mucosa which alters the gradient of
oxygen concentration and increases the concentration of nitrates favoring the growth of pathogenic ﬂora.
Furthermore, the slowing down of intestinal transit, frequent drugs (sedatives, opioids, catecholamines),
and the alteration of the mechanisms of microbial elimination (decreased production of bile salts and
IgA, pharmacological alkalinization of pH, etc.) may also inﬂuence the alteration of the digestive
functions [122]. Freedberg et al. observed that colonization by some microorganisms prior to admission
in ICU was associated with increased risk of infection by that same germ, and subsequently increased
mortality [123]. This fact indicates that the gastrointestinal microbiome can help stratiﬁcation and early
identiﬁcation of the risk of ICU patient complications.
Eczema or atopic dermatitis (AD) is the ﬁrst typical allergic manifestation in newborns [137].
A recent study has reported a high proportion of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii on the gut microbiome
from AD subjects. The presence of these bacteria is lower in Crohn’s disease patients, as well as
anti-inﬂammatory fecal bacteria metabolites [138]. Besides, it has been shown that infants with AD
improved their symptomatology when the abundance of fecal Coprococcus eutactus, a butyrate-producing
bacterium, is increased [139]. Consequently, it has been proposed that dysbiotic gut microbiota and
subsequent dysregulation of the gut inﬂammation may promote an aberrant Th2-type immune response
to allergens altering the epithelial barrier in AD skin [140].
