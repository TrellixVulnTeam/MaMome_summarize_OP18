Trial enrolled 881 pregnant women at 3 clinical sites in the US
(Boston, Massachusetts; St. Louis, Missouri; and San Diego,
California). Inclusion criteria included a personal history of
asthma or allergy in the pregnant woman or in the father of
the fetus. The intervention phase occurred during preg-
nancy, and after birth infants were followed every 3 months
for the development of respiratory disease and other outcomes.
An ancillary study of the child intestinal microbiome was
initiated during follow-up, after roughly one-half of the chil-
dren reached 3 months of age. Stool samples were collected
from infants between age 3 and 6 months. Caretakers were in-
structed to collect approximately 2.5 milliliters of child stool
from a diaper using a tongue depressor 1-2 days prior to a study
visit and to store the sample in a home freezer until bringing
it to the visit in a freezer pack. The only exclusion criterion
for stool collection was antibiotic use by the infant in the prior
7 days. The study followed procedures in accordance with the
ethical standards of the participating institutions, and ap-
proval was obtained from the institutions’ committees on
human subjects.
Questions regarding the child diet were asked beginning at
age 6 months. We used responses obtained at the 6 month ques-
tionnaire (or later if 6-month data was incomplete or missing)
to ascertain the infant diet at the time of the stool collection.

We analyzed maternal diet as the ﬁrst principal compo-
nent of the maternal food frequency questionnaire responses,
which represented high intake of vegetables and low intake of
processed meats and deep fried foods (Tables II and III; avail-
able at www.jpeds.com). In unadjusted analyses, high intake
of vegetables and low intake of processed meats and deep fried
foods during pregnancy was positively associated with Shannon
diversity index (increase of 0.08 for every 1 increase in the ﬁrst
PC (PC 1); P < .001) and richness (increase of 1.56 for every
1 increase in PC 1; P < .001; Table IV). However, in models
adjusted for demographic and other dietary characteristics, these
differences were no longer statistically signiﬁcant.
In unadjusted analyses of 4 genera selected a priori based
on prior literature suggesting associations with early diet and
health outcomes,7-10,22-25 we found that high maternal intake
of vegetables and low intake of processed meats and deep fried
foods was inversely associated with Bacteroides spp (decrease
in 0.19 log counts for every 1 increase in PC 1; P = .03) and
Clostridium spp (decrease in 0.15 log counts for every 1 increase
in PC 1; P = .03) counts (Table IV). However, after adjusting
for demographic variables (mode of delivery, age, treatment,
maternal education, and race/ethnicity), breastfeeding vs
formula feeding and solid food introduction, the only asso-
ciation between the maternal diet and taxa selected a priori
for analysis was a positive association with Lactobacillus spp
(mean difference = 0.48; P = .02).
In crude analyses, both the Shannon diversity index and rich-
ness were signiﬁcantly lower among breastfed infants com-
pared with formula-fed infants (1.92 ± 0.42 vs 2.37 ± 0.36,
P < .001; and 26.5 ± 7.13 vs 34.8 ± 6.40, P < .001, respectively,
Table IV). These differences remained after adjustment for de-
mographic and other dietary variables. In analyses of genera
selected a priori for analysis, adjusted for demographic factors,
we observed signiﬁcantly higher relative abundances of
Biﬁdobacterium spp (mean difference 0.51; P = .02), Lactoba-
cillus spp (mean difference 3.87; P < .001), and Clostridium spp
(mean difference 0.75; P = .05) among breastfed vs formula-
fed infants. Results were similar after adding solid foods and
maternal diet as covariates to the adjusted model.
In unadjusted analyses, both the Shannon diversity index
and richness were signiﬁcantly higher among infants who had
solid foods introduced by the time of the stool collection com-
pared with infants who had not yet had solid foods intro-
duced (2.30 ± 0.43 vs 2.14 ± 0.43, P = .002 and 33.5 ± 7.72 vs
30.5 ± 7.40, P = .001, respectively; Table IV). However, these
differences were attenuated and no longer statistically signiﬁcant
after adjustment for demographic factors alone, and after ad-
justment for demographic and other dietary factors. We did
not detect an association between solid foods and relative abun-
dance of Bacteroides spp, Biﬁdobacterium spp, Lactobacillus spp,
or Clostridia spp in unadjusted analyses. After adjusting for de-
mographic variables, solid food introduction was positively as-
sociated with Clostridium spp (mean difference = 0.80 log
counts; P = .03) and this association remained signiﬁcant after
addition of infant breastfeeding vs formula feeding status and
maternal diet to the adjusted model (mean difference = 0.75
log counts, P = .05).
We next asked whether race/ethnicity inﬂuenced the
association between the infant’s diet and the intestinal
microbiome by including an interaction term between race/
ethnicity and breast milk vs formula in models adjusted for
demographic and other dietary variables. There was no sig-
niﬁcant interaction with regard to Shannon Index (P = .17),
richness (P = .66), Bacteroides spp counts (P = .55), or
Clostridium spp counts (P = .65). There was a trend toward race/
ethnicity × breastfeeding status interactions with regard to
Biﬁdobacterium spp counts (P = .10) and Lactobacillus spp
counts (P = .09). Consequently, we analyzed the association
between breastfeeding status and those taxa (Biﬁdobacterium
and Lactobacillus), stratiﬁed by race/ethnicity. We found that
Biﬁdobacterium spp counts were similar among breastfed and
formula-fed African American infants, and Hispanic and white
breastfed infants had higher levels of Biﬁdobacterium spp com-
pared with formula-fed Hispanic and White infants (African

The PC 1 of maternal diet during pregnancy was dichotomized at its mean for comparisons of low and high groups, and used as a continuous variable in regression models.
Mean, SD for normally distributed variables (Shannon index, Richness).
Median, 25%-75% range for count data.
Linear regression was used in analyses of Shannon Index, and richness and negative binomial regression was used in analysis of bacterial counts. b coefficients of bacterial counts represent a
difference in the log count, formula fed is reference.
The Shannon index is a measure of diversity that accounts both for number of species present and for how evenly distributed bacterial counts are across the species that are present.
*Demographic variables: treatment, mode of delivery, age, maternal education, and race/ethnicity of child.
†Dietary variables: infant breastfeeding vs formula feeding and infant solid food.
‡Dietary variables: infant solid food and first principal component of maternal diet (high in vegetables and low in processed meats and deep fried foods).
§Dietary variables: infant breastfeeding vs formula feeding and first principal component of maternal diet (high in vegetables and low in processed meats and deep fried foods).
American mean difference = 0.38 log counts, Hispanic mean
difference = 0.52, White mean difference 0.50; Table V and
Figure 2). Conversely, Lactobacillus spp counts tended to be
higher among breastfed African American infants compared
with breastfed Hispanic and White infants (African Ameri-
can mean difference = 6.34 log counts, Hispanic mean
difference = 2.53, White mean difference 3.08; Table V and
Figure 2).
When maternal education was added as a covariate,
the strengths of interactions between breastfeeding vs
formula feeding status and race/ethnicity were weakened
(Biﬁdobacterium spp P = .12; Lactobacillus spp P = .21). Because
maternal education and race/ethnicity were highly associ-
ated (P = < .001 for c2 test), it is likely that interaction strengths
were attenuated due to collinearity. Excluding race/ethnicity
from the model, the interaction between breastfeeding status
and maternal education was not signiﬁcant for either
Biﬁdobacterium spp (P = .45) or Lactobacillus spp (P = .73),
further supporting stronger associations of microbial differ-
ences by infant diet group with race/ethnicity than maternal
education.

Comparison of our ﬁndings with those of other studies is
not straightforward due to different ages studied, variable mi-
crobial proﬁling methods, and heterogenous analytic tech-
niques. In an ethnically homogeneous population using targeted
quantitative polymerase chain reaction on stool samples col-
lected at age 1 month, Penders et al showed breastfed infants
had less Clostridia difﬁcile compared with formula-fed infants.7,30
This contrasts with our ﬁnding of a positive association between
breastfeeding and overall Clostridia spp, though we expect that
the inﬂuence of breastfeeding differs among individual species
within this genus. Consistent with our results, breastfeeding
is thought to increase Biﬁdobacterium spp. However, we did
not observe the decrease in Bacteroides spp with breastfeeding
that has been seen in other studies,7,8 possibly because of the
relatively old age of our participants.
Our study has limitations. Because infant diet was in-
ferred from questionnaires administered after stool sample
collection, misclassiﬁcation of the exposure may have oc-
curred; however, this would have introduced a null bias. Subjects
who had taken antibiotics in the 7 days leading up to stool
sample collection were not included in this analysis, though
it is possible that exposure to antibiotics earlier in life or
during pregnancy had effects on the microbiome that we
were not able to account for. However, we do not anticipate a
strong association between likelihood of receiving antibiot-
ics and the dietary factors examined here, so any bias is
anticipated to be random and not systematic. Our ﬁndings
may also have limited generalizability: although the popula-
tion studied is diverse, parents were selected with a personal
history of allergy or asthma. It is unknown whether the
microbiome of children with a family history of atopy may
respond differently to diet than children without such a family
history.
