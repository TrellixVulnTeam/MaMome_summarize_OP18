In  2005  the  international  haplotype  map  (HapMap)  project
was  initiated  to  identify,  based  on  genome-wide  association
studies 
in  ethnically  different  populations,  single
nucleotide  polymorphisms  (SNPs)  and  their  association  with
speciﬁc  human  diseases  and  individual  phenotypic  character-
istics,  respectively  [3,4].  Through  GWAS  an  increasing  number  of
gene  loci  have  been  identiﬁed  that  are  associated  with  individual
(future)  phenotypic  traits,  such  as  hair  or  eye  color,  height,  body
mass  index  and  others  as  well  as  with  the  disposition  to  develop  a
speciﬁc  disease  [3,4].  Further,  genetic  variants  are  associated  with
the  individuals’
  response  to  drug  treatment,  e.g.,  to  lithium  [5].
Overall,  GWAS  allow  an  increasingly  better  understanding  of
disease  pathogenesis  and  a  more  accurate  assessment  of  the
individual  risk  to  develop  a  speciﬁc  disease.  Clinically,  this  may
eventually  translate  into  clinical  advances  in  disease  prevention,
early  diagnosis  and  therapy.  It  should  be  cautioned,  however,  that
the  contribution  of  a  deﬁned  SNP  to  the  risk  assessment  for  a
given  disease  must  be  weighed  against  established  clinical
parameters  and  needs  to  be  carefully  evaluated  before  entering
clinical  practice.
The  human  microbiome  project  (HMP)  was  established  in  2007
as  another  global  consortium  [6–10].  The  HMP  and  the 
‘Meta-
genomics  of  the  Human  Intestinal  Tract  (Meta-HiT)  Consortium
Europe’
  aim  at  the  sequencing  of  all  microbes  (eukaryotes,  archaea,
bacteria,  viruses)  that  inhabit  speciﬁc  body  sites,  such  as  the
mouth,  throat  and  airways,  stomach  and  intestine,  the  urogenital
system  and  the  skin,  respectively  (Fig.  1A).  Recent  data  demon-
strate  that  speciﬁc  compositions  of  the  microbial  community  are
associated  with  health  and  disease  [6–10]  and  suggest  that  the
detailed  characterization,  function  and  variation  of  the  microbial
community  will  reveal  important  commensal  host-microbe  as  well
as  microbe-microbe  interactions  with  diagnostic,  therapeutic  and
preventive  implications  [11,12].
While  the  HMP  has  meanwhile  developed  into  a  major

Taken  together,  the  emerging  data  suggest  that  the  detailed
characterization  of  the  human  intestinal  microbiome  composition,
function  and  variation  across  different  body  sites  will  reveal
important  commensal  host-microbe  as  well  as  microbe-,  microbe
interactions  that  may  play  a  role  in  human  health  and  disease.
In  view  of  the  numerous  and  diverse  physiological  functions  of
the  intestinal  microbiota  in  human  health  (Table  1)  it  is  not
surprising  that  it  is  also  involved  in  gastrointestinal  as  well  as  non-
gastrointestinal  diseases,  such  as  obesity/metabolic  syndrome,  and
atherosclerosis/cardiovascular  as  well  as  neurologic/psychiatric
diseases,  making  it  one  of  the  most  dynamic  current  topics  in
biomedical  research  (Table  2).  In  the  following,  a  few  examples  will
be  discussed  in  more  detail.
