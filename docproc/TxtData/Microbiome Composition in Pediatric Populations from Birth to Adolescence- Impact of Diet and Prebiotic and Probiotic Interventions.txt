Introduction

Over the past decade, the essential role that the gut micro-
biota plays in the developmental programming of the neo-
nate, including growth trajectories, metabolism, and immune 
and cognitive development, has been demonstrated  
Thus, fostering the development of the microbiome in the 
first 1000 days of life is critical to supporting lifelong health. 
Due to the rapid changes in the gut microbiome in the early 
postnatal period, most pediatric microbiome research has 
focused  on  differences  between  breast-  and  formula-fed 
infants in the first year of life  Few studies have evaluated 
the microbiota of toddlers and children, and the prevailing 
thought is that children attain an adult-like microbiota by 
3 years of age  However, recent studies suggest that 
maturation of the gut microbiota is influenced by diet, and 
differences from an adult-type microbiota persist into later 
childhood  Therefore, the goal herein was to review 
the current evidence for the role of dietary intake and pre- 
and probiotic interventions on the gut microbiota from birth 
through adolescence.

Early Life 

Breast‑ and Formula‑Feeding

Among pediatric populations, gut microbiota composi-
tion of breastfed (BF) and formula-fed (FF) infants is most 
extensively studied and has been reviewed elsewhere [3, 
4]. While heterogeneity exists among demographics, infant 
age, formula type, and sampling and analytical techniques 
applied in the published literature, most studies show that 
both diversity and richness of the microbiome are lower in 
BF than FF infants  Breastfeeding, particularly 
of longer duration, is associated with a more stable bacte-
rial composition as well as a lower microbiota age 

and lower Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes than FF infants [2, 
6]. Breastfeeding is strongly associated with Bifidobacte-
rium  
For example, in the TEDDY (The Environmental Deter-
minants of Diabetes in the Young) cohort, BF infants had 
higher relative abundance of B. breve, B. bifidum, and B. 
dentium than FF; while B. longum was the most dominant 
species in this study, it did not differ by feeding group  
Lactobacillus abundance has also been associated with 
breastfeeding  however, results vary considerably 
among published studies  In a recent meta-analysis of 
seven studies, infants who were not exclusively BF har-
bored higher relative abundances of Bacteroides, Eubac-
terium, and Veillonella 

Feeding mode interacts with other perinatal factors to 
influence the infant gut microbiota. Ho and colleagues 
reported  that  non-exclusively  BF  infants  have  a  lower 
abundance of Proteobacteria, but only among those deliv-
ered via cesarean section (C-section)  However, breast-
feeding  appears  to  moderate  the  detrimental  effects  of 
C-section delivery and intrapartum antibiotics on the early 
microbiota, producing a microbiota profile more similar to 
that of vaginally delivered infants or those not receiving 
antibiotics  Geography and ethnicity are also important 
to take into account. Across five European countries, the 
effect of country was more pronounced than delivery or 
feeding method, with dominant bifidobacteria in north-
ern countries and greater early diversification in southern 
European countries  Within the USA, Bifidobacterium 
abundance differed between white and Hispanic BF and FF 
infants, but not black infants 

Compared to BF infants, the functional capacity of the 
microbiome of FF infants is more similar to that of adults, 
consisting  of  genes  related  to  bile  acid  synthesis  and 
methanogenesis, but considerable variation exists among 
recent studies  For example, the BF infant microbi-
ome has an increased abundance of genes associated with 

1 3Digestive Diseases and Sciences 

carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and fatty acid biosyn-
thesis than FF  although another study reported similar 
data related to fatty acid biosynthesis genes, but opposite 
results for carbohydrate and lipid metabolism  Com-
pared to FF infants, the BF infant’s microbiome has more 
genes associated with vitamin and cofactor metabolism 
 and glutathione metabo-
lism  Discrepancies among the studies could be due to 
differences in infant age or the inclusion of mixed-feeding 
infants (MF) in different feeding groups. Thus, more work 
is needed to understand the functional ontogeny of the 
infant gut microbiota.

Human milk (HM) contains nutrients, bioactive compo-
nents, and bacteria that drive the aforementioned differences 
in the gut microbiota of BF and FF infants. In particular, the 
human milk oligosaccharides (HMO) are complex glycans 
that are resistant to digestion and exert a number of func-
tions in the distal gastrointestinal tract of the infant  
Over 200 unique HMOs have been identified, and maternal 
genetics affects the HMO present in milk  HMOs 
shape the infant gut microbiota by acting as a prebiotic sub-
strate for select beneficial bacteria, such as certain species 
of Bifidobacterium, as well as, acting as a decoy receptor 
for pathogenic microorganisms  The addition of HMOs 
and other prebiotics to infant formula over the last decade 
has likely resulted in some convergence in the microbiota 
of BF and FF infants and will be discussed later in this 
review. Along with the HMOs, BF infants receive a con-
tinuous source of bacteria from HM  The HM micro-
biome is dominated by Staphylococcus and Streptococcus, 
but also contains Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Clostrid-
ium, and Veillonella, all resident genera found in the early 
infant microbiome  Hundreds of bacterial species 
are present in HM  and composition is associated 
with a variety of maternal factors such as body mass index, 
delivery mode, geography, and breast pump usage  The 
microbial compositions of HM and infant feces are strongly 
associated  thus, the unique microbial composition of 
each mother’s milk may account for some variation in the 
gut microbiome of BF infants  While HMO and the 
HM microbiome are most widely studied in relation to the 
infant microbiota, other HM components, such as IgA, anti-
microbials, glycoproteins  
and fungi  likely contribute to development of the early 
microbiome.

Introduction of Complementary Feeding 
and Cessation of Breastfeeding

Ruminococcaceae, Blautia, Bacteroides, and Akkermansia 
and decreases in Bifidobacterium, Veillonellaceae, 
Lactobacillaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, and Enterococcaceae 
 However, early feeding mode continues to remain evi-
dent throughout these dietary transitions, influencing infant 
gut microbiota composition even up to 2 years of age  
Whether an infant is BF during solid food introduction influ-
ences microbial patterns (Table 1). Con-
tinued breastfeeding provides substrates necessary to sustain 
microbes such as Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Collinsella, 
Megasphera, and Veillonella (Table 1). Introduction 
of foods high in protein and fiber increases microbial diver-
sity, but the particular foods most correlated with microbial 
diversity differ depending on whether the infant is still being 
breastfed  For example, a greater number of predicted 
functional changes were identified in FF and MF infants dur-
ing introduction of solids compared to BF infants, suggest-
ing that breastfeeding may increase the plasticity of the infant 
microbiome 

As energy-yielding substrates change over the first year 
of life, so does the metabolic capacity of the infant micro-
biome, with increases in genes associated with starch, cen-
tral carbon, and pyruvate metabolism  During weaning 
from HM or formula, milk-associated bacteria decrease and 
microbes capable of degrading complex polysaccharides, such 
as Bacteroidaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Ruminococcaceae, 
increase  Breastfeeding duration influences when these 
transitions occur; at 12 months, richness and diversity were 
highest among infants weaned before 6 months and lowest 
among those still being BF  Similarly, the microbiota 
of BF infants residing in Italy and Burkina Faso have been 
shown to cluster fairly close together, despite vast differences 
in the diets [high fiber vs. high fat/protein] and the environ-
ments [urban vs. rural] of the two countries  However, 
once children were fully weaned, the microbiota of children in 
Burkina Faso was dominated by Bacteroidetes, while that of 
Italian children was enriched with Firmicutes 

Previously, cessation of breastfeeding, rather than comple-
mentary food introduction, was proposed to be the driving 
force behind the shift toward an adult-like microbiome  
However, both contribute to this transition to different degrees 
among infants  Still, studies investigating changes in the 
microbiome upon weaning and introduction to solid foods are 
limited  Additional large, longitudinal cohort studies are 
needed to explore the compositional and functional changes 
of the microbiota that accompany dietary shifts in early life.

Microbiota composition increases in both diversity and rich-
ness during the transition from a milk-based to an adult-
like  diet    Introduction  to  complementary  foods  is 
accompanied  by  marked  increases  in  Lachnospiraceae, 

Although studies on gut microbiota composition in children 
after 2 years of age are more limited, available evidence sug-
gest that the microbiota of young children differs from that

of adults  As children consume a more complex diet, 
associations between dietary patterns and the gut microbiota 
emerge, and their microbiota composition becomes more 
similar to adults  How diet affects the gut microbiota 
can be interrogated at several levels, starting with specific 
nutrients, such as fiber  to categories of foods, or food 
groups  to more complex assessments of dietary 
intake, such as dietary patterns  A summary of the 
impact of diet on gut microbiota composition is shown in 
Table 1 and is discussed below.

Toddlers 

In Australian 2- to 3-year-olds, both habitual diet, as meas-
ured by a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), and recent 
dietary intake, as measured by a 24-h recall 3 days prior to 
fecal sample collection, influenced fecal microbiota com-
position  Dairy intake was negatively associated with 
species richness and diversity and Bacteroidetes abundance, 
but was positively associated with Erysipelatoclostridium 
spp. and the Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio [F/B ratio]. 
Vegetable  protein  intake  was  positively  associated  with 
abundances of the Lachnospira; soy, pulse, and nut intake 
were positively associated with Bacteroides xylanisolvens, 
and fruit intake was negatively associated with the relative 
abundance of microbes related to Ruminococcus gnavus 
 Dairy and vegetable-source proteins explained 7–10% 
of the variation in microbiota composition and fruit intake 
explained 8%. Among the dairy group, yogurt explained 9% 
of the variance in microbiota 

Young Childhood to Adolescence 

Moving beyond the first 1000 days of life, Berding and cow-
orkers investigated the temporal stability of the fecal 
microbiota and whether dietary patterns were associated 
with microbial taxa and composition in American 4–8-year-
olds at 3 time points over a 6-month period. Dietary intakes 
were assessed over the previous year using the Young Ado-
lescent Questionnaire, and two dietary patterns were identi-
fied by principal components analysis (PCA) and factor anal-
ysis  Temporal stability of microbiota over the 6-month 
period was associated with baseline dietary patterns. Dietary 
pattern 1, defined by intake of fish, protein foods, refined 
carbohydrates, vegetables, fruit, juice and sweetened bev-
erages, kid’s meals and snacks and sweets, was linked to 
higher relative abundance of Bacteroidetes,  Bacteroides, 
and Ruminococcus and lower Bifidobacterium, Prevotella, 
Blautia, and Roseburia relative abundance. Dietary pat-
tern 2, defined by intake of grains, dairy and legumes, nuts 
and seeds, was associated with higher Cyanobacteria and 
Phascolarctobacterium abundance and lower Dorea and 
Eubacterium abundance  Additionally, the intake of 

snacks and sweets and refined carbohydrates were nega-
tively correlated with both Shannon and the Chao1 Indices, 
respectively, demonstrating reduced microbial diversity with 
greater intake of sugars and refined grains.

Residing in rural vs. urban environments can also affect 
food availability and choices, which has been investigated 
in a series of studies. A study of Filipino children (7 to 
9 years) living in rural (Baybay) and urban (Ormoc) com-
munities showed distinct differences in dietary habits and 
fecal microbiota composition  Nearly all of urban 
children consumed fast food four times per week on average 
compared to 42% of rural children who consumed fast food 
less than once per week. Urban-dwelling children also con-
sumed a diet higher in meat, fat, and confectionaries, such 
as sweetened pastries and biscuits, and lower in complex 
carbohydrates compared to rural children. Using family-level 
bacterial composition to execute PCA and clustering analy-
sis in conjunction with a dataset from five other Asian coun-
tries, it was observed that 87.5% of rural children fell into 
the termed P-type cluster [defined by Prevotellaceae] and 
78.9% of the urban samples were included in the termed BB-
type cluster (defined by Bacteroidaceae, Bifidobacteriaceae, 
Ruminococcaceae,  and Lachnospiraceae).  Additionally, 
Prevotellaceae, including only the genus Prevotella and 
consisting of mostly Prevotella copri, were more abundant 
in the feces of rural children, making up 10% of the total 
community, whereas it represented < 1% of the fecal micro-
bial sequences in most urban children. These findings may 
reflect the higher consumption of complex carbohydrates in 
rural children. 

Similarly, Kisuse and colleagues examined differences 
in dietary habits, fecal microbiome composition, and short-
chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentrations of children (9 to 
10 years) living in rural (Buriram) and urban (Bangkok) 
settings in Thailand  Urban children consumed more 
bread, meat, and beverages and less rice and vegetables than 
the rural children. Vegetables comprised < 1.0% of total cal-
orie intake in urban children compared to 7.3% in rural chil-
dren. The fecal microbiome of the rural children displayed 
significantly greater alpha diversity (Chao1 index). The 
microbiota of rural children was enriched by bacteria in the 
order Clostridiales, containing families such as Peptostrep-
tococcaceae and unclassified Ruminococcaceae, compared 
to higher proportions of Actinobacteria, Bacteroidales, and 
Selenomadales in urban dwellers. Additionally, rural chil-
dren had significantly higher fecal butyrate and propionate 
concentrations, suggesting that the fiber-rich diet in the rural 
children promotes a microbiota composition with greater 
fermentative capacity 

Greater Bifidobacterium abundance in 1- to 4-year-olds 
compared to adults has been reported  and recent stud-
ies have shown that the relative abundance of Bifidobac-
terium in older children is related to dietary intake and is 

1 3 

Digestive Diseases and Sciences

associated  with  metabolic  phenotypes.  Studying  Dutch 
children in the KOALA Birth Cohort Study, Zhong and col-
leagues documented higher levels of Bifidobacterium at 6 
to 9 years of age compared to adults  They also classi-
fied children into three enterotypes and observed that cor-
relations between dietary and metabolic phenotypes were 
dependent on fecal microbial enterotype. For example, a 
negative correlation between dietary fiber intake and plasma 
insulin was only reported in children with Bacteroides and 
Prevotella enterotypes, but not the Bifidobacterium entero-
type  This latter microbiome possesses lower microbial 
gene richness, alpha diversity, and functional potential for 
butyrate and succinate production, suggesting that children 
exhibiting a Bifidobacterium enterotype have a less mature 
gut microbiome  Additionally, a study of 8- to 11-year-
olds in Thailand living in two different geographical regions 
observed that frequency of vegetable intake was positively 
correlated with Lactobacillus and Prevotella, while Bifido-
bacterium spp. was negatively correlated with fish and beef 
intake 

A similar study of healthy 7- to 12-year-olds from China 
and Malaysia, living in three different cities, showed that 
geographical-related factors (including diet), rather than 
other potential mediating factors, such as ethnicity (e.g., 
Southern Chinese or Malay children), was a major delinea-
tor of microbiome changes  Four genera (Bacteroides, 
Fecalibacterium, Bifidobacterium, and Collinsella) showed 
significant associations with the 15 food groups under obser-
vation. Bifidobacterium and Collinsella were positively cor-
related with refined-sugar enriched foods, and Collinsella 
was also positively associated with fruit and curry intake 


Parallel to these findings, comparing Bangladeshi and 
American  children    Bangladeshi  children 
exhibited lower levels of Bacteroides and higher levels of 
Prevotella,  Butyrivibrio,  and Oscillospira,  indicative  of 
their consumption of a non-Western diet low in refined-
sugar enriched foods and meat and rich in rice, bread, and 
lentils  Furthermore, the American children consuming 
Western diets had higher Bacteroides abundance than chil-
dren in Bangladesh  A Bacteroides enterotype is more 
common in adults consuming a Western diet, whereas the 
Prevotella enterotype is more common in those consuming 
high amounts of fiber 

Lastly,  a  study  comparing  Egyptian  teenagers  (mean 
13.9 years) consuming a Mediterranean-style diet to Ameri-
can teenagers (mean 12.9 years) consuming a Western diet, 
found that Egyptian children clustered to the Prevotella ente-
rotype and American children clustered to the Bacteroides 
enterotype  Furthermore, the gastrointestinal environ-
ment of Egyptian children contained higher levels of SCFAs, 
microbial polysaccharide degradation-encoding genes, and 
polysaccharide-degrading genera 

Taken  together,  these  findings  provide  evidence  that 
the microbiome in children and adolescents is shaped to a 
greater degree by dietary intake than by ethnicity 
 While it is has been postulated that the microbiota after 
age 3 resembles that of adults  emerging evidence sug-
gest that, while the microbiota of children can be assembled 
into enterotypes  differences persist between 
children  and  adults.  Additionally,  children  may  also  be 
more similar to each other than adults are. For example, 
in  pre-adolescent  children  (ages  7–12)  intragroup  simi-
larity in the fecal microbiota was greater in children than 
adults  Adults also displayed greater abundances of 
Bacteroides spp., while children displayed enhanced Bifi-
dobacterium spp., Faecalibacterium spp., and members of 
Lachnospiraceae  However, the current literature on 
the impact of diet in this age group has some noted limita-
tions. Nearly all studies are cross-sectional, they use differ-
ent types of questionnaires to collect dietary intake data, and 
many of the studies have compared children living in rural 
vs. urban settings. While dietary intake differs between rural 
and urban communities, many other environmental factors 
are also likely contributing, including socioeconomic status, 
exposure to agricultural species and routine medical care, 
which could also be influencing the gut microbiota.

Fiber and Prebiotic Interventions in Children 
on Gut Microbiota

A consistent finding of the observational studies summa-
rized above is that consumption of a Western-style diet, 
characterized by low ratio of whole grains-to-refined carbo-
hydrates, detrimentally influences microbiome composition 
and fecal SCFA concentrations in children  Dietary 
fiber (DF) has documented health benefits for adults, includ-
ing reducing intestinal transit time, plasma cholesterol and 
postprandial glycemic response and improving resistance 
to pathogens and epithelial barrier function  The 
underlying mechanisms of these beneficial effects are not 
fully known; however, gut microbiome modulation and for-
mation of SCFAs by bacterial fermentation are proposed 
 DF is also thought to be beneficial for gut health of 
children  although more studies are needed. In the USA, 
the recommended dietary fiber intake is 14 g/1000 kcal or 
25 g for females and 38 g for males. Most Americans only 
consume about half of the recommended intake (13.5 and 
18 g, respectively)  The fiber intake recommendations 
for children between the ages of 1 and 13 years, range from 
5 to 31 g/day, depending on the organization, however, in 
most cases children are not meeting the recommended fiber 
intakes  Thus, various strategies have been developed 
for modulation of gut microbiota, including administration 
of DFs, pre- or/and probiotics.

1 3Digestive Diseases and Sciences 

In 2009, the Codex Alimentarius Commission defined 
DF as “carbohydrate polymers with 10 or more monomeric 
units, which are not hydrolyzed by the endogenous enzymes 
in the small intestine of humans”  DF includes non-
digestible carbohydrates naturally occurring in food, isolated 
from food or synthesized, the latter two requiring evidence 
to support their physiological benefit to health  Most 
countries adopted the 2009 Codex definition by inclu-
sion of carbohydrate polymers with degrees of polymeriza-
tion between 3 and 9  DFs have been classified based 
on their physiochemical properties such as particle size, fer-
mentability, solubility, and viscosity, and these properties 
influence the functionality of a DF, including its ability to 
modulate gut microbiota  Soluble and readily ferment-
able DFs are referred to as prebiotics, which are “a substrate 
that is selectively utilized by host microorganisms conferring 
a health benefit.”  Most prebiotics are DF, but not all DF 
are considered to be prebiotics.

Infant Formula and Prebiotics

HMOs are considered prebiotics, which may partly explain 
the differences in microbiota composition between BF and 
FF infants  To narrow the gap between HM and infant 
formula, prebiotics are now routinely added to infant for-
mula. The most studied prebiotics are a 9:1 mixture of short-
chain galactooligosaccharides (scGOS) and long-chain fruc-
tooligosaccharides (lcFOS). Other prebiotics supplemented 
to infant formula, either alone or in combination, include 
GOS, FOS, polydextrose, lactulose, acid oligosaccharides, 
oligofructose, and inulin  The effect of prebiotics on the 
composition of infant microbiota has been recently reviewed 
 most studies show that prebiotics increase the abundance 
of Bifidobacterium and sometimes Lactobacillus compared 
to infants fed control formula  Several studies reported 
a decrease in opportunistic pathogens, such as Escherichia 
coli, enterococci, and clostridia 

Two HMOs, 2′-fucosyllactose and lacto-N-ne-
oteraose (LNnT), are added to infant formula. Both are well 
tolerated  and  support  age-appropriate  growth  of  infants 
 A multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial com-
pared the fecal microbiota of healthy infants fed formula 
with 2′-FL and LNnT from < 14 days to 6 months of age 
to infants consuming with control formula. Findings dem-
onstrated a fecal microbiota closer to that of BF infants in 
the infants fed formula with HMO, with higher numbers of 
Bifidobacterium and lower potential pathogens than placebo 
at 3 months of age 

DF and Prebiotics in Children

Only a few studies have studied DFs and prebiotics on the 
gut microbiota in healthy 3–6-year-old children and 

adolescents  As prebiotic 
fibers, both GOS and inulin-type fructans have been shown 
to increase abundance of Bifidobacterium  Several 
studies have demonstrated that the intake of DFs shape the 
gut microbes of children; however, their effects on micro-
biota  composition  depend  on  the  type  of  fiber  studied. 
For example, administration of wheat bran extract (5 g/d 
for 3 weeks) increased fecal Bifidobacterium  while 
consumption of soluble corn fiber (SCF; 10 or 20 g/d for 
4 weeks) modulated the overall microbiota, increased the 
alpha diversity and altered the relative abundances of some 
bacterial genera, including Parabacteroides and unclassi-
fied Lachnospiraceae  This same group also showed 
that GOS increased calcium absorption 
in adolescent girls and boys, demonstrating a health benefit 
for this age population. The authors proposed that bacte-
rial fermentation of SCF to SCFAs reduced the luminal pH, 
which increased calcium solubility and transcellular absorp-
tion  Calcium absorption was negatively correlated with 
Parabacteroides relative abundance, but positively corre-
lated with Clostridium and unclassified Clostridiaceae abun-
dance  The authors speculated that the two groups of 
bacteria were cross-feeding, with the Bacteroidetes (Para-
bacteroides) fermenting SCF to acetate or lactate, and the 
Firmicutes (Clostridium) further fermenting these substrates 
to butyrate  The limited studies suggest that prebiotic 
and DF doses of 5–20 g are well tolerated in children, pro-
mote the expansion of bifidobacterial populations, and may 
exert other health benefits. Further large-scale studies are 
needed with different fiber sources.

Probiotic Interventions in Children on Gut 
Microbiota

Probiotics are “live microorganisms that, when administered 
in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host” 
 The most commonly administered probiotic bacteria 
belong to the genera Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, 
but can be provided either as single or mixtures of strains. 
The beneficial effects of probiotics in pediatric populations 
have  been  previously  reviewed    although  most 
studies have not been conducted in healthy children. Pro-
biotics shorten the duration of acute gastroenteritis, prevent 
antibiotic-associated diarrhea, reduce the risk of necrotiz-
ing enterocolitis in preterm infants and lower the incidence 
of eczema in high-risk children  The mechanisms 
of action of probiotics are not fully understood; however, 
modulation of gut microbiota has been postulated as one of 
the mechanisms 

Two general probiotic approaches have been taken to 
influence the infant or child microbiota. The first approach 
is to administer the probiotic to the mother during pregnancy

and  then  to  either  the  mother  and/or  infant  postpartum 
(Table 3), and the second is to administer the pro-
biotic directly to the infant or child (Table 4). For 
the first approach, most studies gave probiotics to the moth-
ers of infants with high-risk of allergy, with the goal of 
prevention of allergic disease, such as eczema, asthma and 
allergic rhinitis  The impact of maternal pro-
biotic supplementation on the abundances of bacterial taxa 
were studied  however, the results are inconsistent, 
even when the same probiotic strain was used 
(Table 3). For example, supplementation of pregnant and 
lactating women with L. rhamnosus GG (LGG), L. acidophi-
lus La-5 and B. animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 from 36-week 
gestation until 3 months postnatal during breastfeeding did 
not affect the proportions of bacteria classes and genera of 
the infants at 3 months and 2 years  In contrast, a Finish 
study evaluated the effect of administration of L. rhamnosus 
LPR and B. longum BL999 to mothers 2 months before and 
2 months after delivery. They observed that infants whose 
mother received probiotics had lower counts of Bifidobacte-
rium and a higher percentage of Lactobacillus/Enterococcus 
than placebo at 6 months of age  In addition, several 
groups investigated the diversity of infant microbiota, report-
ing that administration of probiotics during pregnancy and 
lactation, or directly to infants after delivery have no or lim-
ited effects on alpha and beta diversity of infant microbiota 
(Table 3).

Probiotics have been administrated directly to infants and 
children (Table 4). These studies varied in terms of 
age of the children (newborns to age 18), type of probiotic, 
dose administered, and duration of the intervention. Despite 
these differences in study design, no effects of probiotic 
administration were observed on microbiome alpha or beta 
diversity between children in probiotic and control groups, 
with the exception of one study  In that study, formula 
or L. reuteri DSM 17938-supplemented formula was fed for 
6 months to newborns born by either vaginal or C-section 
delivery  The L. reuteri-supplemented formula had a 
limited effect on the microbiota of vaginally born infants; 
however, the overall microbiota composition of C-section-
delivered infants consuming the probiotic-supplemented 
formula differed from that of placebo and was similar to 
vaginally delivered infants at 2 weeks of age 

Similar to the findings when probiotics were adminis-
tered  to  the  mother,  inconsistent  results  were  observed 
on the abundances of bacterial taxa when probiotics were 

supplemented  directly  to  the  children;  some  probiotics 
affected the proportions of individual bacterial taxa, while 
others did not (Table 4). These conflicting results may be 
related to differences in probiotic strain/strains used, the 
dose use, duration of administration, and the methods used 
for microbiota analysis. Furthermore, factors that influence 
the development of gut microbiota, such as delivery mode, 
children’s age, and diet, likely confound the effects of pro-
biotic supplementation in this population 

While some encouraging data exist on the efficacy of pro-
biotics on disease prevention, no broad consensus exists to 
recommend the use of probiotics in these conditions  
Although probiotics are safe for use in healthy population; 
several concerns have been raised related to the administra-
tion of probiotics early in life when gut microbiota is not 
fully established. Long-term consequences of such admin-
istration should be carefully evaluated 

Future Directions

There is a need for more dietary intervention studies in 
healthy populations, as the majority of currently published 
studies describe dietary interventions in the context of dis-
ease states, such as obesity, which is represented by micro-
bial dysbiosis  In particular, randomized, controlled 
clinical trials on the effects of DFs, prebiotics, and probiotics 
are needed in pediatric populations, particularly in adoles-
cence to young adulthood  where there is a 
paucity of data available. Additionally, long-term follow-
up studies of early-life dietary interventions are needed to 
determine long-term effects. For example, it is not known 
whether or not early-life acceleration toward an adult-like 
microbiome has negative downstream effects on health. 
None of the reported human studies report effects on host 
gut gene expression, which is possible to do noninvasively 
in pediatric populations using exfoliated epithelial cells 
and 
incorporating other multi-omic approaches, including the 
fecal metabolome will further our understanding of 
the complex relationships between diet, gut microbiota, and 
human health and disease and can lead to the development of 
low-cost, safe and efficacious dietary interventions  
These “microbiota-directed foods” have the potential to 
prevent or treat some of the most pressing health nutritional 
challenges facing the world’s population.

Key Findings and Implications for Clinicians

•  The gut microbiota in infancy and childhood is more 

readily shaped by nutrition than during adulthood.

•  The microbiome of BF infants is nurtured by human milk 
components, including HMO, and differs from that of FF 
infants.

•  The addition of HMO and prebiotics to infant formula at 
concentrations found in human milk promotes the growth 
of bifidobacteria and narrows the differences between BF 
and FF infants.

•  Prebiotics  and  dietary  fiber  at  doses  of  5–20  g/day 
modify the gut microbiome of children, increase SCFA 
production, and may exert other health benefits, includ-
ing increasing calcium absorption.

•  Findings on probiotic administration to pregnant or 
lactating women or directly to the infant or child are 
inconsistent, likely due to the variation in the bacterial 
strains, doses, duration and methods of microbiome 
analysis.

•  Better understanding of diet–microbiome–host interac-
tions is needed, but represents an enormous opportunity 
to refine dietary interventions with the goal of supporting 
a healthy microbiome and human well-being.
