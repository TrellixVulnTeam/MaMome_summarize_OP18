riage patterns far exceeded what was initially
suspected (Aagaard et al. 2012a,b; Human Mi-
crobiome Project 2012a,b,c; Huse et al. 2012;
Gevers et al. 2012; Li et al. 2012). These initial
studies on the “healthy” reference human mi-
crobiome laid the foundation for a burgeoning
wealth of investigations of the potential role of
the microbiome in a spectrum of health and
disease states. Indeed, associations between
dysbiotic microbiota, or a microbial imbalance,
and disease have been suggested for obesity, type
II diabetes mellitus, ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s
disease, and colorectal cancer (Mangin et al.
2004; Ley et al. 2005; Gophna et al. 2006; Man-
ichanh et al. 2006; Turnbaugh et al. 2006, 2008,
2009; Ba¨ckhed et al. 2007; Cani et al. 2007; Will-
ing et al. 2009; Larsen et al. 2010; Schwiertz et al.
2010; Wu et al. 2010; Joossens et al. 2011; Lepage
et al. 2011; Marchesi et al. 2011; Sobhani et al.
2011; Qin et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2012; Devaraj
et al. 2013). However, causation has yet to be
established, and a multitude of other etiologies
for these common, complex disorders have been
suggested over the decades. Thus, it is critical-
ly important to ﬁrst discriminate when in the
course of the lifespan there is normal and antic-
ipated variation in the human microbiome,
in which body niches such variation occurs,
and what other covariates (such as host disease-
susceptible genotype, host metabolic milieu and
associated disorders, as well as age, gender, race/
ethnicity, and medications and diet) may con-
tribute to any observed variation.

Our laboratory and others have shown that
the vaginal microbiota vary in association with
normal pregnancy, thus providing a unique
“signature” in pregnancy with relative alter-
ed abundance of multiple taxa (Aagaard et al.
2012b; Romero et al. 2014b). This is intriguing,
as the vaginal microﬂora inﬂuences gestational
and postnatal health. It has long been suggested
that intrauterine infections, such as chorioam-
nionitis, are the sequelae of ascending micro-
biota from the upper vaginal tract (Gonc¸alves
et al. 2002), and the development of highly mor-
bid neonatal conditions, such as neonatal sepsis
and necrotizing enterocolitis, are potentially at-
tributable to anatomical displacement of these
ﬂora with subsequent inﬂammation and neona-

tal acquisition (Claud and Walker 2001; Guthrie
et al. 2003; Yee et al. 2012). However, in this
dawning era of metagenomic medicine and sci-
ence, we are questioning these notions, and are
coming to appreciate that many so-called “ster-
ile” niches—notably in and among the female
reproductive tract (such as the placenta)—may
function as active low biomass ecologic niches
that harbor unique microbiomes. These early
observations challenge not only our assumed
notions of “from when and where” our earliest
microbiomes are colonized (or seeded), but our
concepts of inﬂammatory mediators, reproduc-
tive immunity, and whether microbes in such
niches may constitute more friend than foe.

Here, we will review the literature on how
the microbiome is studied and how metageno-
mic science tools have been used in characteriz-
ing microbial communities and their genomic
repertoire (Table 1). We will thereafter discuss
ﬁndings by our group and others pertaining to
the microbial ecology of pregnancy, with a focus
on the potential role of the microbiome in me-
diating parturition and notably preterm birth.
Finally, we will close with a discussion on future
implications and applications as metagenomic
medicine emerges as a frontier for both under-
standing and managing the most common and
complex disorders of our current time.

METAGENOMIC SCIENCE: METHODS,
APPLICATIONS, AND CHALLENGES
IN THE FIELD

Mapping the human microbiome in repro-
duction requires that we not only characterize
which microbes are present and what each taxon
contributes to the biology of the host, but what
their genetic repertoire entails and encodes for
(so-called “gene carriage patterns”). Numerous
methods have been developed to address these
questions over the years, and with the advent
of Next Generation (Next-Gen) sequencing, in-
vestigators have been able to relatively eff-
iciently describe the composition of a microbial
community. Additionally, other multi’omic
techniques (e.g., metabolomics and metatran-
scriptomics) have been developed to attribute
potential functions and metabolic capacity.

16S-Based Metagenomics

Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene using Next-
Gen technology has recently been widely ex-
ploited to characterize the human microbiome
(Jonasson et al. 2007; Liu et al. 2007). The 16S
rRNA gene is an ideal target to classify bacteria
because of the nine hypervariable regions in this
gene that can be used to distinguish species
based on individual nucleotide polymorphisms
. Ergo, Next-Gen sequencing charac-
terizes both coarse ( phylum level) as well as ﬁne
(genus and limited species and strain) differ-
ences using universal primers to the adjacent
conserved regions (Klindworth et al. 2013).
However, 16S-amplicon-based approaches are
limited to a shorter read length as compared
with Sanger sequencing, and as a result, only
a few hypervariable regions can be contigu-
ously sequenced at a time. Initial work on ap-
proach and validation by the HMP Consortium
showed that there is variation in the taxonomy

proﬁle identiﬁed based on sequencing different
variable regions. For example, V1V3 amplicons
may underestimate Acinetobacter and Escheri-
chia genera, but V3V5 provides both breadth
and depth of communities dominated by these
genera. Furthermore, V6V9 may underesti-
mate Bacteroides but provides good coverage
for Pseudomonas and Escherichia (Human Mi-
crobiome Project 2012b).

Comparison of the vaginal microbiome
data from the HMP reveals that V1V3 will
distinguish communities primarily by the rela-
tive predominant Lactobacillus species present
whereas, V3V5 amplicons will reveal either lac-
tobacilli-dominant or lactobacilli-diminished
groups. Furthermore, the number of Lactobacil-
lus species detected (and thus relative abun-
dance) will vary depending on the 16S region
sequenced, with V1V3 revealing more unique
Lactobacillus operational
taxonomic units
(OTUs) as compared with V3V5 (Huse et al.
2012). However, unlike V3V5, V1V3 does not

Figure 1. The 16S rDNA gene is an ideal target for classifying bacteria. (A) The 16S rDNA gene of bacteria
contains nine hypervariable regions (V1–V9) that are ﬂanked by conserved regions, which makes this gene an
ideal target for PCR ampliﬁcation and bacterial classiﬁcation. The V1V3 and V3V5 primers sets used by the
HMP consortium are outlined. The dotted line indicates the direction of ampliﬁcation. (B) Advantages and
disadvantages to characterizing the vaginal microbiome with V1V3 (includes V2) and V3V5 (includes V4)

tial when examining the pregnant microbiome.

fully discriminate Enterobacteriaceae family
projections (including Escherichia and Proteus),
and some genera (including Staphylococcus) (Fig.
1B) (Fettweis et al. 2012). Few studies have di-
rectly compared the vaginal communities de-
scribed by V6, V7, V8, and V9 to other primer
sets, although a number of studies have used
these regions with good coverage (Hummelen
et al. 2010; Ghartey et al. 2014). Taken together,
these data emphasize the need for prudent con-
sideration when choosing primer sets for se-
quencing with appreciation of both the body
site to be characterized, the reference data set
to be compared with, and limitations when
comparing to other published ﬁndings.

Numerous bioinformatics suites, such as
Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology
(QIIME), Mothur, and Genboree, have been
developed speciﬁcally to handle the taxonomic
information gathered from 16S studies (Schloss
et al. 2009; Caporaso et al. 2010; Riehle et al.
2012). These tools streamline the process of qual-

ity ﬁltering, operation taxonomic unit (OTU)
picking, chimeric sequence removal and taxo-
nomic assignment. For rapid and accurate tax-
onomic assignment, several reference databases,
including Ribosomal Database Project (RDP),
SiLVA, and Greengenes, have curated full length
16S sequences for more than 700 distinct taxa
(DeSantis et al. 2006; Pruesse et al. 2007; Wang
et al. 2007). Lastly, these bioinformatics tools
can perform basic microbial community anal-
ysis, including measuring alpha diversity (with-
in sample variation) and beta diversity (be-
tween sample variation).

Whole Genome Shotgun (WGS)-Based

approach to perform metagenomics studies,

capacity to capture total gene content and met-
abolic capacity (Butler et al. 2008; Liu et al.
2012; Morgan et al. 2012; Qin et al. 2012; Aa-
gaard et al. 2014). However, the sheer volume
of data generated by this approach poses sig-
niﬁcant bioinformatics challenges (Prakash and
Taylor 2012). On receiving sequence reads,
quality ﬁltering is performed to remove human
contamination, which consists of .90% of
reads in vaginal or placental samples (Human
Microbiome Project 2012c; Aagaard et al.
2014). To get species assignment to provide po-
tential gene expression information, sequence
reads are ﬁrst assembled into contigs, or genes.
This is challenging because of the lack of refer-
ence genomes, which results in de novo assembly
of microbial genomes with the potential to dis-
tort the species abundance and generate chime-
ric genomes (Pop 2009). Following assembly,
gene prediction is then possible by analyzing
molecular characteristics of existing open read-
ing frames of sequenced genomes (Zhu et al.
2010). Given the complexity of assembly and
low efﬁciency, taxonomy classiﬁcation can also
be achieved by alignment of sequence reads
to clade-speciﬁc markers identiﬁed from inte-
grated microbial genomes (IMG) without prior
assembly (Segata et al. 2012). The reconstruc-
tion of functional proﬁle is achieved by map-
ping reads onto pathway collections such as
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
(KEGG), with additional interference steps for
pathway coverage and abundance (Abubucker
et al. 2012). Further, web tools have recently
been developed to perform the tasks described
above to facilitate the analysis of WGS data
(Glass et al. 2010). However, regardless of ap-
proach, WGS and 16S sequencing are limited to
describing community composition and its po-
tential metabolic or functional capability.

Multi’omics Data Integration

To truly understand how the microbiome im-
pacts human health, metabolomic and meta-
transcriptomic approaches will be required to
characterize their precise roles as symbionts
(reviewed in Morgan and Huttenhower 2014).
Metatranscriptomics, unlike its DNA-based

counterparts, reveals dynamic gene expression
patterns and nonprotein-coding small RNAs
present in microbial communities. Therefore,
metatranscriptomics can elaborate more pre-
cisely how bacteria are contributing to host bi-
ology. However, the current challenge in this
area of research is how to remove host nucleo-
tides and rRNA while preserving the shorter
microbial transcripts (Booijink et al. 2010; Go-
salbes et al. 2011; Schmieder et al. 2012). Once
this challenge is overcome, the analysis of meta-
transcriptomics could use previous statistical
methods developed for RNA-seq studies.

Metabolomics will be similarly critical for
linking bacterial function to host health. Al-
though studying the collection of metabolites
associated with a microbial community is not
unlike studying single organisms, associating
individual metabolites with the microbe of
origin is a signiﬁcant challenge. Because mi-
crobes provide metabolic capabilities otherwise
unavailable to the host, observing alterations in
metabolites through changes in diet or the use
of antibiotics in correlation with the micro-
biome may help us decipher the interrelation-
ships between bacteria and their corresponding
metabolomics (Zhang et al. 2010; Sellitto et al.
2012; McHardy et al. 2013). Although it is cur-
rently challenging to fully integrate multi’omics
data, meaningful associations are beginning
to be established through correlations, network
analysis, and co-occurrence analysis (Shi et al.
2011; Faust et al. 2012; McHardy et al. 2013;
Morgan and Huttenhower 2014).

THE VAGINAL MICROBIOME IN
REPRODUCTIVE AGED WOMEN

Before the advent of Next-Gen sequencing, the
the vaginal microbiome
characterization of
through traditional microbiological techniques
(culture-dependent) revealed a predominance
of Lactobacillus species (Redondo-Lopez et al.
1990; Larsen and Monif 2001). These early
characterizations of the vaginal microbiome
resulted in the delineation of “normal” ﬂora
(deﬁned as Lactobacillus predominant), and
“abnormal” or “aberrant” vaginal ﬂora (non-
lactobacillus predominant). Early descriptions

also attempted to characterize abnormal vaginal
ﬂora, most notably in conjunction with bacterial
vaginosis (BV). BV is a common and complex
alteration of vaginal ﬂora, but the description of
the bacteria involved in the vaginal dysbiosis
has changed over time. The association be-
tween anerobic cocci and abnormal vaginal dis-
charge was ﬁrst described by Curtis in 1914, and
Gardnerella vaginalis was ﬁrst described as a
causative agent for BV in 1955 (Eschenbach
1993; Ledger 1993). However, by the 1990s,
multiple other species were found in anaerobic
cultures of vaginal discharge from subjects with
symptoms consistent with BV (Faro et al. 1993;
Hillier et al. 1993). Despite the multiplicity of
causative agents, one common ﬁnding is that
women experiencing clinically symptomatic
BV tend to be deﬁcient in lactic acid producing
species of bacteria that also convert oxygen to
H2O2 (Eschenbach et al. 1989; Hillier et al. 1992,
1993). This observation has led to several de-
cades of data demonstrating that adverse repro-
ductive health outcomes accompany “abnormal
ﬂora” associated with BV (Gravett et al. 1986;
Martius et al. 1988; Krohn et al. 1991; Hillier
et al. 1995a; Martin et al. 1999; Wiesenfeld et al.
2003; Ness et al. 2005; Brotman et al. 2010). For
instance, the incidence of BV has been associat-
ed with preterm birth and with increased risk
for acquiring sexually transmitted diseases, such
as Neisseria gonorrhea, Chlamydia trachomatis,
and human immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV)
(Gravett et al. 1986; Martius et al. 1988; Krohn
et al. 1991; Kurki et al. 1992; Hillier et al. 1995b;
Martin et al. 1999; Wiesenfeld et al. 2003; Ness
et al. 2005; Brotman et al. 2010; Perla et al.
2012). This
infection is
increased risk of
thought to be because of the deﬁciency of Lac-
tobacillus species that produce lactic acid and
H2O2 to provide protection from pathogenic
bacteria and viruses (Eschenbach et al. 1989).
Along these lines, previous in vitro studies have
shown that Lactobacillus acidophilus can protect
from infection with G. vaginalis, Bacteroides bi-
vius, and HIV through a peroxidase dependent
mechanism (Klebanoff and Coombs 1991; Kle-
banoff et al. 1991). Thus, although BV may in-
dicate vaginal dysbiosis in a clinical setting, there
has been historically a lack of data regarding

Perinatal Microbiome and Pregnancy

whether vaginal dysbiosis occurred as “normal”
ﬂora in women asymptomatic for BV. Currently,
Next-Gen sequencing techniques have enabled
the vaginal microbiome to be more thoroughly
characterized to determine the bacterial ﬂora of
the “normal” versus “abnormal” vagina.

One of the ﬁrst studies to reveal the com-
plexity of the vaginal microbiome using Next-
Gen techniques was performed by Ravel et
al. This study recruited nearly 400 women of
mixed ethnicities. Samples were prepared for
either V1V2 16S sequencing and were scored
for BV using Nugent criteria (Ravel et al. 2010).
Five distinct community state types (CSTs) were
revealed, and the majority of these CSTs were
dominated by species of lactobacilli. The fourth
CST included women with a vaginal micro-
biome deﬁcient in Lactobacillus species, and in-
terestingly, this group had increased incidence
of BV. Also, this study showed that the vagi-
nal microbiome could be distinguished by eth-
nicity. Asian subjects had a higher prevalence of
CST III (Lactobacillus
iners), non-Hispanic
Caucasians had a higher prevalence of CST I
(Lactobacillus crispatus), and African-American
and Hispanic subjects had a higher prevalence
of CST III (L. iners) and IV (decreased Lactoba-
cillus species) (Ravel et al. 2010). However, re-
cent studies have shown the caution that must
be used when performing analysis such as CSTs
(Koren et al. 2013). In these investigations, Ko-
ren et al. showed that these types of clus-
ter analysis are sensitive to the distance metric
used for analysis and that multiple distance
metrics should be used to promote accuracy
in data. In fact, this study used the data of Ravel
et al. in their analysis and found varying
support for the presence of CSTs based on the
analysis used (Koren et al. 2013). Thus, multiple
methods of analysis must be used to establish
a CST. An additional method that may be use-
ful to examine microbiome communities across
ethnicities is to use single nucleotide poly-
morphisms (SNPs) in mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA), which provides more precision in
analysis (Ruiz-Pesini et al. 2007). We have re-
cently used this method in conjunction with
analysis of the microbiome through data lever-
aged from the HMP to examine associations

between mtDNA haplotypes and microbiome
communities (Ma et al. 2014a). Although we
did see similar microbiome communities as
the Ravel group, our analysis has provided a
molecular basis in which to describe the struc-
ture of microbiome communities (Ma et al.
2014a).

Although this initial study revealed the
complexity of the vaginal microbiome, it did
not determine the stability of the vaginal mi-
crobiome. This aspect was queried in a separate
study in which 32 subjects, mostly African-
American and non-Hispanic Caucasian, self-
collected vaginal samples over a 16 wk time
frame (Gajer et al. 2012). Intriguingly, the sta-
bility of the vaginal microbiome over time ap-
peared to vary by individual. In other words,
some women tended to have high variability
in their vaginal microbiome, even to the extent
in which the CST classiﬁcation of their vaginal
microbiome was altered up to three times over
the course of the study (Gajer et al. 2012). How-
ever, other women tended to have an incred-
ibly stable vaginal microbiome throughout the
study (Gajer et al. 2012). Because this study had
a limited number of subjects and ethnic diver-
sity, it is challenging to determine how host
genetics may be associated with variability in
the stability of the vaginal microbiome between
subjects. Thus, utilizing the mtDNA haplo-
groups described above may be of great utility
in future studies that examine the stability of any
microbiome community over time. Additional-
ly, ﬂuctuations in alpha diversity were associat-
ed with the menstrual cycle, such as increased
levels of estradiol and progesterone correspond-
ed to decreased diversity (Gajer et al. 2012). In-
creases in these hormones promote the presence
of lactic acid producing bacteria, which main-
tain low pH and low diversity in the vagina.

Alterations in the vaginal microﬂora attrib-
uted to pH have been described to have func-
tional consequences as well. Using inferred
function analysis obtained from WGS sequenc-
ing data, the HMP consortium noted that a
decrease in the vaginal pH corresponded to
an increase in metabolic activity, speciﬁcally
when examining the phosphate transport sys-
tem (Human Microbiome Project 2012c). Even

further, a recent study examined the vaginal
metatranscriptomics proﬁle of
two women
with healthy vaginal proﬁles and two women
diagnosed with BV. This group found that
there were distinct differences in expression of
CRISPR-related genes, butyrate production,
and glycogen metabolism (Macklaim et al.
2013). In women with healthy vaginal micro-
ﬂora, glycogen metabolism resulted in the pro-
duction of lactic acid although subjects with
BV had an increase in succinate production
(Macklaim et al. 2013). What is even more in-
triguing is that some of these differences ap-
peared to be attributable to gene regulation by
L. iners. Thus, this study exempliﬁes the need
for further metatranscriptomic and metabolo-
mic studies involving large cohorts to under-
stand the role of the reproductive microbiome
in health and disease.

THE VAGINAL MICROBIOME IN
PREGNANCY

With the demonstration that the vaginal micro-
biome ﬂuctuates based on the menstrual cycle,
with intercourse, and (to a much more limited
degree) with clinical symptoms of BV, we and
others sought to characterize the vaginal micro-
biome during pregnancy. Nearly every organ
system changes during pregnancy to promote
pregnancy maintenance or prepare for parturi-
tion. In the vagina, increased vascularity and
hyperemia develop in the skin of the vulva and
the mucosa of the vagina. Additionally, the vag-
inal mucosa increases in thickness and cervical
secretions increase, which causes the underlying
smooth muscle cells to hypertrophy and relax
the connective tissue. At the epithelial surface,
the vaginal epithelium hypertrophies and caus-
es a crowding of the epithelial cells, which are
rich in glycogen (Nieburgs 1947). Estrogen
(namely estradiol) rises across gestation, and
further leads to increases in glycogen levels; gly-
cogen is metabolized into lactic acid resulting in
the decrease pH (acidity) of the vagina (Gre-
goire et al. 1971; Paavonen 1983). This metab-
olism of glycogen into lactic acid was historical-
ly thought to be performed by the vaginal
epithelium, because the vaginal lumen is sufﬁ-

ciently distant from the oxygen supply to be-
come anaerobic. However, the primary source
of lactic acid became debated when Boskey et al.
reported that vaginal lactobacilli were capable of
producing lactic acid in vitro at a rate sufﬁcient
to reacidify the vagina in vivo following a neu-
tralizing exposure (i.e., ejaculate) (Boskey et al.
1999; Pybus and Onderdonk 1999). Afterward,
the speciﬁc lactate structures in the vagina were
explored and it was discovered that the majority
of the vaginal lactic acid was of the D-isoform,
which cannot be produced by human metabo-
lism (Boskey et al. 2001). Thus, vaginal bacteria,
namely lactobacilli, appear to be the primary
source of lactic acid in the vagina. In pregnancy,
the preponderance of Lactobacillus
species
appears to be aided by the estrogen-induced
increase in glycogen that contributes to the
vaginal acidic environment, which is not only
enhanced by lactobacilli but also fosters Lacto-
bacillus growth.

Before the advent of metagenomics, the
presence of lactobacilli were noted to increase
as gestational age advanced during pregnancy
(Nieburgs 1947). Further, more recent studies
showed a high prevalence of Lactobacillus spe-
cies in the vagina during either the ﬁrst, second,
or third trimester using PCR-denaturing gra-
dient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) for the V3
region of the 16S rRNA gene, and the species
with the highest prevalence were L. acidophilus
and L. iners (Herna´ndez-Rodrı´guez et al. 2011).
The utilization of Next-Gen sequencing tech-
niques to study the vaginal microbiome further
showed the presence of Lactobacillus species in
the vagina during pregnancy. Our group initial-
ly published this 16S-based metagenomic char-
acterization in a cross-sectional study (Aagaard
et al. 2012b). We used V3V5 16S sequencing
and examined the posterior fornix, mid-vagi-
na, and vaginal introitus of 24 gravid and 60
nongravid subjects. Vaginal samples collected
from a cross-sectional survey of gravid subjects
from 18 wk gestation to term or delivery, and
all samples were collected by a single physician
who also conducted the HMP sampling for
50% of subjects. All samples were extracted in
a manner identical to that used by the HMP, and
sequenced on the same pipelines. When com-

Perinatal Microbiome and Pregnancy

pared with the HMP nonpregnant reference
subjects, we found that pregnancy was associat-
ed with an altered vaginal microbiome and
marked by a decrease in alpha diversity at the
subgenus level .
When we examined this phenomenon further,
we discovered that there was an overall enrich-
ment of the orders Lactobacillus, Clostridiales,
Bacteriodales, and Actinomycetales. And on
probing at the species level using supervised
machine learning approaches, such as linear
discriminate analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe)
and Boruta feature selection, we discovered that
the vaginal microbiome during pregnancy was
enriched in L. iners, L. crispatus, Lactobacillus
jensenii, and Lactobacillus johnsonii (Aagaard
et al. 2012b). The increase in lactobacilli may
be explained by the increase in estrogen that
occurs during pregnancy. However, direct asso-
ciations between speciﬁc species of Lactobacillus
and estrogen levels are lacking and warrant fur-
ther investigation.

However, the aforementioned studies were
cross-sectional, which allows for the character-
ization of a pregnancy and gestational age-com-
mon microbiome signature, but lacks capacity
for description of the dynamic changes, which
may occur in an individual over time. Longi-
tudinal analysis of the vaginal microbiome in
a small cohort of women across gestation has
been performed using terminal restriction frag-
ment length polymorphism (tRFLP) in 100
gravid women (Verstraelen et al. 2009). This
study categorized gravidae into two cohorts
during the ﬁrst trimester: lactobacilli-dominant
and lactobacilli-diminished. Interestingly, only
16.9% of gravidae that had a lactobacilli-dom-
inant vaginal microbiome in the ﬁrst trimester
decreased the prevalence of lactobacilli during
pregnancy. On the other hand, 56.5% of gravi-
dae with a lactobacilli-diminished vaginal
microbiome during the ﬁrst trimester gained
prevalence of this genus. In contrast to the
cross-sectional study, these longitudinal co-
horts showed that L. crispatus dominated dur-
ing pregnancy and that prominence of Lactoba-
cillus gasseri and/or L. iners during the ﬁrst
trimester may be associated with diminished
lactobacilli as pregnancy progressed (Verstrae-

Figure 2. Inﬂuences on the pregnant microbiome. A number of hormonal changes, environmental exposures
and genetic differences may impact the maternal microbiome before and during pregnancy that may alter the
developing neonatal microbiome. During pregnancy, the maternal intestinal and vaginal microbiome have
reduced alpha diversity and species richness. Metabolic demands increase throughout pregnancy and after
parturition as the mother is lactating. Estradiol, progesterone and prolactin levels gradually increase during
pregnancy, although it is unclear how these changes affect the maternal microbiome. Increased estrogen raises
glycogen production in the vagina, but how the availability of this substrate structures the vaginal microbiome is
unknown. The effect of host genetics on the maternal microbiome throughout pregnancy is relatively unknown.
Different ethnicities, which can be inferred by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotypes, have been shown to
have varied vaginal microbiomes before and after pregnancy. Further studies are needed to understand these
differences, and to explore the effect of host genotype on the maternal microbiome. The impact of diet and
obesity on the pregnant microbiome is just beginning to be explored. A primate model of maternal high fat diet
showed that diet alone can persistently alter the juvenile microbiome at one year of age regardless of juvenile diet.
However, how diet alters the maternal environment during pregnancy and how this affects the vertical trans-
mission of bacteria is unknown.

len et al. 2009). Recently, Romero et al. have
performed longitudinal studies of the posterior
fornix of the vaginal microbiome during preg-
nancy using Next-Gen sequencing of the V1V2
region of the 16S rRNA amplicon (Romero et al.
2014b). These studies used the self-collection of
vaginal samples over 16 wk of the nonpregnant
cohort and swabbing of the posterior fornix at

four prenatal visits from the gravid cohort with
22 subjects. Additionally, the gravid cohort con-
sisted of mainly African-American ethnicity. In
their analysis, the authors used the CSTs estab-
lished by Ravel et al. to interrogate the vaginal
microbiome during pregnancy (Ravel et al.
2010; Romero et al. 2014b). This study conclud-
ed that the vaginal microbiome of gravid wom-

en mostly consisted of the CST I or III with odds
ratios of 2.986 and 2.136, respectively, and that
the vaginal microbiome of gravid women shift
toward these two CSTs as their pregnancy
progressed (Romero et al. 2014b). When the
stability of the vaginal microbiome was exam-
ined during pregnancy, the authors noted that
the vaginal microbiome of gravid subjects shift-
ed between CSTs dominated by lactobacilli but
rarely shifted to CST IV, which is marked by a
diminished abundance of Lactobacillus species
(Romero et al. 2014b). However, with a low
number and low ethnic diversity of subjects in
the study, further studies are needed to conﬁrm
these shifts of the vaginal microbiome toward
CSTs dominated by lactobacilli as pregnancy
progresses. Initial studies of the vaginal micro-
biome showed that African-American women
have a higher prevalence of vaginal CSTs con-
sisting of Lactobacillus species (Ravel et al. 2010),
which was further shown by this recent study
(Romero et al. 2014b). In a separate study, the
vaginal microbiome was examined longitudi-
nally during gestation using the V3V5 amplicon
of 16S rRNA in 12 subjects that were mostly
Caucasian (Walther-Anto´ nio et al. 2014). In
agreement with previous studies, these authors
showed that alpha diversity decreases as preg-
nancy progresses and that L. crispatus and
L. iners dominate the vaginal microﬂora (Fig.
2) (Walther-Anto´ nio et al. 2014). Intriguingly,
these authors suggest that maternal age may be
important for the dominance of L. crispatus or
L. iners, with, L. iners being dominant in older
gravidae (Walther-Anto´ nio et al. 2014). Al-
though this insight should be kept in mind for
future studies, this study had only two subjects
with advanced maternal age (Walther-
Anto´ nio et al. 2014). To take these studies
further, this group attempted to analyze their
data in conjunction with the Romero et al.
study; however, differences in primer sets and
sequencing platforms used in these separate
studies prevented in depth analysis (Romero
et al. 2014b; Walther-Anto´ nio et al. 2014).
Despite these challenges, the authors found
that, although alpha diversity of the vaginal
microbiome decreased with gestational age in
both African-American and Caucasian subjects,

Perinatal Microbiome and Pregnancy

African-American subjects had increased beta
diversity between gravid subjects whereas Cau-
casian gravidae did not (Walther-Anto´ nio et al.
2014). Thus, these studies highlight the need for
further longitudinal studies with large subject
enrollment and ethnic diversity. Additionally,
studies are needed with a high enrollment of
BV subjects or women with a dysbiotic vaginal
microbiome to lend further insight into vaginal
microbiome shifts and stability that are associ-
ated with pregnancy.

In addition to better understanding shifts in
the vaginal microbiome during pregnancy, in-
vestigating the microbiome of subjects with BV
may lend insight into the role of the vaginal
microbiome in preterm birth. It is known that
BV is associated with preterm birth (Martius
et al. 1988; Krohn et al. 1991; Hillier et al.
1995a,b), and therefore, it is logical to question
the potential association of the vaginal micro-
biome with preterm birth (Ganu et al. 2013).
The Preterm Prediction Study examined the as-
sociation between BV and preterm birth (PTB)
(Meis et al. 1995). In this study, vaginal speci-
mens were obtained at 24 and 28 wk gestation,
and an association with increased risk for spon-
taneous PTB at ,35 wk gestation was found in
19.8% of women with BV at 28 wk gestation
(Meis et al. 1995). However, conclusions could
not be drawn regarding whether BV itself was
causative of PTB (Meis et al. 1995). Additional-
ly, although treatment of BV during pregnancy
does eradicate infection, it does not reduce the
risk of PTB (Hillier et al. 1995b; Brocklehurst
et al. 2013). Therefore, given the lack of beneﬁt,
screening of asymptomatic women in pregnan-
cy is not recommended (Nygren et al. 2008).
Even more concerning are the ﬁndings of two
studies that found an increase in preterm de-
livery (,34 wk) among women who tested
negative for BV but were treated (Hauth et al.
1995; Vermeulen and Bruinse 1999). Thus, the
relationship of BV and preterm birth is com-
plicated and the beneﬁt of treatment is ques-
tionable. These issues regarding BV and PTB
warrant further investigation into these associ-
ations, and the examination of the microbiome
using Next-Gen sequencing techniques will be
of great utility for these studies.

Despite the need for further investigation
into the role of the vaginal microbiome in as-
sociation with BV and preterm birth, a recent
study by Hyman et al. has examined
the vaginal microbiome in preterm birth. This
group used a prospective cohort study with 46
high-risk ( previous unexplained PTB) and 42
low-risk (all other gravid) subjects for PTB
gravidae enrolled (Hyman et al. 2014); however,
only 14 subjects were able to be sampled in each
trimester. Intriguingly, the investigators found
that the presence of lactobacilli did not distin-
guish term (.37 wk) from preterm (,37 wk)
subjects using Sanger sequencing methods.
However, low-risk subjects had a higher preva-
lence of lactobacilli when compared with high-
risk subjects (Hyman et al. 2014). Despite the
lack of association of lactobacilli with preterm
birth, measured alpha diversity was reported as
diminished when comparing Caucasian term
and preterm subjects (Hyman et al. 2014).
Among the two longitudinal subjects that ulti-
mately delivered preterm, their vaginal micro-
biomes were dominated by L. crispatus (Hyman
et al. 2014), which is in contrast to a previous
study demonstrating that L. crispatus is domi-
nant in healthy term pregnancies (Verstraelen
et al. 2009; Aagaard et al. 2012b). Moreover,
although two subjects in the Hyman et al. study
had outgrowths of Biﬁdobacterium and Urea-
plasma genera, separately, these genera are re-
ported in both normal pregnant subjects as well
as nonpregnant (Ravel et al. 2010; Aagaard et al.
2012b; Romero et al. 2014b). Similar ﬁndings
were found in an independent study by Romero
et al. In this prospective study, term 
versus preterm (,34 wk) subjects were sam-
pled at the posterior fornix by an obstetrician
and sequenced using V1V3 primers (Romero
et al. 2014a). The authors found no associa-
tion between the CSTs of the vaginal micro-
biome and preterm birth, nor did they ﬁnd
any CST of the vaginal microbiome associated
with preterm subjects having acute chorioam-
nionitis (Romero et al. 2014a). In contrast to
the study by Hyman et al., this study found no
signiﬁcant difference in the alpha diversity of
the vaginal microbiome of term and preterm
subjects (Hyman et al. 2014; Romero et al.

2014a). In summary, although promising, these
studies underscore the need for broader gesta-
tional age-speciﬁc, reference-based cohorts to
deﬁne both the effect size and population vari-
ance. Before the publication of such studies, it
would be premature to ascribe such micro-
biome proﬁling as indicative or heralding of
preterm birth.

VARIANCE OF THE HUMAN MICROBIOME
IN PREGNANCY: BEYOND THE VAGINAL
COMMUNITY

In addition to changes described in the vaginal
microbiome during pregnancy, Koren et al.
investigated the intestinal microbiome
during pregnancy using a prospective cohort
study and found that as pregnancy progressed,
the intestinal microbiome was altered. This
study used the V1V2 region of the 16S rRNA
gene and found that alpha diversity (within
sample variation) was decreased between the
ﬁrst and third trimesters . Further, stool
samples collected from gravidae in the ﬁrst tri-
mester clustered separately from stool samples
collected in the third trimester (Koren et al.
2012). These differences in beta diversity (be-
tween sample variation) were a reﬂection of in-
creases in Proteobacteria in the stool during the
third trimester when compared with stool from
the ﬁrst trimester. When fecal transplants of ﬁrst
and third trimester stool into germ-free mice
were performed, mice receiving third trimester
stool had increases in inﬂammatory cytokines
and adiposity, similarly to fecal transplants in-
volving obese subjects (Turnbaugh et al. 2006;
Koren et al. 2012; Ridaura et al. 2013). These
alterations in the intestinal microbiome did not
associate with any other covariates, such as body
mass index (BMI), development of gestational
diabetes mellitus, or multiparity (Koren et al.
2012).

BEYOND THE VAGINAL MICROBIOME:
EARLY INFANT COLONIZATION

Recently, the establishment of the neonatal
microbiome has been the subject of debate
and investigation. As shown with vaginal micro-

12

biome studies, there has been wide variability
between the use of techniques and the variable
region of 16S used for studies. An initial study
by Schultz and colleagues examined the vertical
transmission of a probiotic, Lactobacillus rham-
nosus GG, from mother to infant (Schultz et al.
2004). Gravid women took the probiotic twice
daily from 30 – 36 wk of gestation. The authors
found that all infants born vaginally con-
tained this probiotic in their stool whereas the
probiotic was only detected in the stool of half
of the cesarean delivered infants (Schultz
et al. 2004). This study showed that vertical
transmission did occur between mother and in-
fant. However, this study included a small sub-
ject number and did not examine the maternal
stool postpartum, which would be relevant to
determine the persistence of the probiotic in
the maternal microbiome that would provide
an opportunity for horizontal transmission.
The maternal microbiome during infancy, and
not solely delivery mode, may be an important
factor in establishing the neonatal microbiome.
In fact, a recent study examining the establish-
ment of the intestinal microbiome of healthy,
term neonates using qPCR found that bacterial
loads between maternal and infant stool were
remarkably similar (Jost et al. 2012). This study
shows that the maternal microbiome at birth
and postpartum may be critical in the establish-
ment and development of the neonatal micro-
biome via horizontal transmission.

When directly examining the intestinal mi-
crobiome of infants born via cesarean or vaginal
delivery, culture-based microbiological tech-
niques have shown differences in the coloniza-
tion of the neonatal
intestinal microbiome,
particularly of Biﬁdobacterium-like bacteria,
Lactobacillus-like bacteria, and Bacteriodes fra-
gilis (Gro¨nlund et al. 1999a). However, a sepa-
rate study by this group also determined that
bacterial enzymes were not altered in the stool
of infants based on mode of delivery (Gro¨nlund
et al. 1999b). Using culture-independent, PCR-
based techniques, Penders et al. also showed
that B. fragilis and Biﬁdobacterium were de-
creased in cesarean delivered infants in compar-
ison to vaginally delivered infants. However, this
study also showed differences in the intestinal

Perinatal Microbiome and Pregnancy

microbiome of infants based on formula-feed-
ing or breastfeeding (Penders et al. 2006). An
Italian study further investigated the intestinal
microbiome of infants based on mode of deliv-
ery using the V6V8 region of the 16S rRNA gene
in PCR-DGGE and PCR-temperature gradi-
ent gel electrophoresis (TGGE) assays (Biasucci
et al. 2008). This group determined that infants
born vaginally had increased diversity in their
intestinal microbiome when compared with ce-
sarean delivered infants. Again, infants born by
cesarean delivery appeared to have an absence of
Biﬁdobacterium in their intestinal microbiome
(Biasucci et al. 2008).

To date, few studies on this issue regarding
mode of delivery have used Next-Gen sequenc-
ing techniques. An initial study was performed
in Venezuela with nine gravid subjects, four giv-
ing vaginal birth and ﬁve having a cesarean de-
livery (Dominguez-Bello et al. 2010). This study
used the V2 region of the 16S rRNA gene and
showed that the infant microbiome most close-
ly resembled the mothers’ vaginal microbiome
following vaginal delivery. Similarly, if the in-
fant was born by cesarean delivery, the infant
microbiome most closely resembled the skin
microbiome (Dominguez-Bello et al. 2010).
Furthermore, a Canadian study using Next-
Gen sequencing techniques for the V5, V6, and
V7 regions of the 16S rRNA gene showed that
Escherichia shigella and Bacteroides were signiﬁ-
cantly diminished in the intestinal microbiome
of infants born by cesarean section (Azad et al.
2013). This study also found that infants with
the highest species richness and diversity of
their intestinal microbiome were born by emer-
gency cesarean section rather than by an elective
cesarean section or vaginally (Azad et al. 2013).
However, when followed out to 4 mo postpar-
tum, infants’ intestinal microbiome could be
differentiated primarily based on mode of feed-
ing. Speciﬁcally, infants that were formula-fed
had a higher prevalence of Peptostreptococca-
ceae and Verrucomicrobiaceae when compared
with breastfed infants (Azad et al. 2013). Thus,
mode of feeding may be more crucial than
mode of delivery in regards to the long-term
establishment of the microbiome. These ﬁnd-
ings suggest that the establishment of a stable

A.L. Prince et al.

microbiome is not only a question of what bac-
teria are present at birth, but also what factors,
either host-derived or environmental, inﬂuence
the species that persist.

Which Microbiota First Populate the Infant?

Further studies into the establishment of the
neonatal microbiome highlight this principle.
Jost et al. showed that the intestinal
microbiome of infants born vaginally and ex-
clusively breastfed decrease the amount of the
Firmicutes phylum, of which Lactobacillus be-
longs, over time while increasing the prevalence
of Bacteroides species. Thus, although these in-
fants were born vaginally, a high presence of
Firmicutes did not persist. Intriguingly, these
vaginally delivered infants could be classiﬁed
into two cohorts in this study: those that had
species of Bacteriodes present in their intestinal
microbiome and those that did not (Jost et al.
2012), and this trend was also seen in a separate
study (Palmer et al. 2007). This is in contrast to
previous studies ﬁnding that Bacteroides relative
abundance differed based on mode of delivery
(Gro¨nlund et al. 1999a; Penders et al. 2006).
However, Palmer et al. also determined that var-
iations in the Bacteroides species seen early in
neonatal life were less variant and more con-
sistent in the abundance by 1 yr of age. Addi-
tionally, the neonatal intestinal microbiome also
appeared more adult-like near the end of the ﬁrst
year of life (Palmer et al. 2007). This ﬁnding was
conﬁrmed in a study by Koenig et al. in which the
intestinal microbiome of an infant was moni-
tored for 2.5 yr. Here, the authors found that
the diversity of the intestinal microbiome in-
creased over time and with the introduction of
foods (Koenig et al. 2011). Also, Bacteroides spe-
cies were found to increase on the introduction
of vegetables (Koenig et al. 2011). Altogether,
this data indicate that the neonatal microbiome
is highly variable within the ﬁrst year of life.
Therefore, various exposures during this time
may have a signiﬁcant impact on the developing
microbiome.

Although it is unclear if the health and
microbiome of the offspring is persistently in-
ﬂuenced by mode of delivery, gestational age at

delivery appears to be the greater arbiter for the
developing microbiome. For instance, differ-
ences in the intestinal microbiome of preterm
and term neonates have been described
(Schwiertz et al. 2003). In this study, the authors
found that healthy, term neonates that were
breast fed had increased diversity in their intes-
tinal microbiome when compared with hospi-
talized, preterm infants using PCR-DGGE anal-
ysis (Schwiertz et al. 2003). Additional studies
have conﬁrmed that the microbiome of infants
with conditions like PTB, very low birth weight
infants, or necrotizing enterocolitis, also have
an altered microbiome (Schwiertz et al. 2003;
Ha¨llstro¨m et al. 2004; Milisavljevic et al. 2013;
Wang et al. 2013). However, it is unclear if these
alterations are caused by early gestational age at
delivery or hospitalization because neonatal ex-
posure in early life is pertinent to the establish-
ment of the microbiome.

Furthermore, these exposures at delivery
and in early life may have lasting effects on the
microbiome (Ding and Schloss 2014; Ma et al.
2014b). For instance, a recent study showed that
breastfeeding has an impact in the long-term
enterotype of an individual (Ding and Schloss
2014). This study is bolstered by murine studies
suggesting that maternal antibodies transferred
via breast milk may have a persistent impact on
the intestinal microbiome (Rogier et al. 2014).
However, retrospective analysis of the literature
determined that mode of delivery may in-
ﬂuence obesity in adulthood (Darmasseelane
et al. 2014). Thus, these aforementioned asso-
ciations with mode of feeding and delivery may
be attributable to differences in the seeding
of the neonatal microbiome. Therefore, future
studies are needed to entail how and why mi-
crobes remain in distinct body sites. In other
words, it may not be a question as to who is
there and from whenst and where do they arise,
but rather why do certain microbes take up and
retain residence? As the maternal diet and mi-
crobiome has been shown to inﬂuence the
establishment and development of the infant
microbiome, these future studies may reveal
early mechanisms of adult metabolic disorders,
which may allow for the early treatment and/or
prevention of associated diseases.

THE PLACENTAL MICROBIOME

The placenta has long been considered sterile in
normal gestation, where the presence of bacteria
in clinical cultures is diagnostic for intrauterine
infection and a signiﬁcant risk for PTB (Hillier
et al. 1988). The ELGAN studies constituted a
large effort that systematically identiﬁed bacte-
ria from PTB placentas under this assumption
(Olomu et al. 2009; Onderdonk et al. 2008a,b).
However, there is increasing recognition of a
large discordance between the presence of bac-
teria as per culture-based diagnoses and clinical
outcome (Watts et al. 1992; Pettker et al. 2007;
Buhimschi et al. 2009; Han et al. 2009; Leviton
et al. 2010; Stout et al. 2013; Combs et al. 2014;
Fortner et al. 2014). In fact, the presence of pla-
cental or membrane bacteria in the absence of
histological infection has been discovered re-
peatedly over the last few decades (Hillier et al.
1988; Steel et al. 2005; Redline 2007; Stout et al.
2013; Fortner et al. 2014). This has led to the
recognition of the need to study and redeﬁne
our understanding of the role of intrauterine
bacteria in gestation.

One of the earliest studies to recognize the
absence of pathogenicity of intrauterine bacte-
ria was performed using histological analysis. It
was shown that membranes of normal pregnan-
cies often contain bacteria, yet show no signs of
histological infection (Steel et al. 2005). Later
studies using similar methodologies discovered
intracellular bacteria localized to the tropho-
blast of the basal plate of the maternal decidua
in the absence of chorioamnionitis although
there was an association with PTB (Cao and
Mysorekar 2013; Stout et al. 2013). Seemingly
in agreement, it was also shown that intra-am-
nionic invasion is relatively benign in the
absence of inﬂammation with associations be-
tween PTB and inﬂammation alone rather
than PTB and bacterial invasion (Combs et al.
2014). Intriguing work by Murtha and col-
leagues showed that high levels of bacteria
were strongly associated with premature rup-
ture of membranes (PPROM) and membrane
thickness, although there was no histological
inﬂammation in half of the subjects. Although
there was bacteria found in subjects of all groups

Perinatal Microbiome and Pregnancy

including PPROM (both term and preterm),
PTB, and even normal gestation controls, there
was no inﬂammation detected in the majority
of subjects (Fortner et al. 2014). Thus, these
studies suggest that it is not the occurrence of
bacteria in the placenta, but the bacterial pop-
ulations present that may initiate intrauterine
infection.

Along these lines, a metagenomic study us-
ing a Rhesus macaque model identiﬁed more
than 300 microbial species in the chorioamnion
and placenta (Aagaard et al. 2013). Interestingly,
it was shown that this population was modiﬁ-
able with a sterile intra-amniotic injection of
IL-1b that induced histological inﬂammation
(Aagaard et al. 2013). This suggests that cho-
rioamnionitis may be caused by microbial dys-
biosis rather than the presence of bacteria per se.
The potential translational implications of this
model to human pregnancy was emphasized
recently by our description of a vibrant and di-
verse commensal placental microbiome in nor-
mal pregnancies (Aagaard et al. 2014). Analysis
of more than 300 human samples using both
16S and WGS sequencing revealed a low abun-
dance complex community dominated by the
phyla Firmicutes, Tenericutes, Proteobacteria,
Bacteroidetes, and Fusobacteria, found in near-
ly all samples. Subjects with a remote history of
antenatal infection and antibiotic treatment, or
who developed PTB, had discrete statistically
signiﬁcant groupings of taxa (Aagaard et al.
2014). It was also found that the placental mi-
crobiome most closely resembles the oral mi-
crobiomes of the supragingival plaque and the
dorsum of the tongue; however, the placental
microbiome did not closely resemble the stool
or the vaginal microbiomes. This implies that
the bulk of the low level placental bacteria are
likely not ascending nor are contaminants of the
stool or the vagina, and instead, are quite pos-
sibly seeded largely from the oral cavity through
hematogenous spread .

The entering of oral microbes into the blood
stream as a result of periodontitis or dental
procedures is well established (Han and Wang
2013), and it has been known for decades that

Figure 3. Speculated origins for microbiota colonizing the placenta and seeding the initial neonatal microbiome.
Vaginal microﬂora likely contribute to the initial seeding of the neonatal microbiome during vaginal deliveries,
but the discovery that the uterine environment may not be sterile suggests that colonization of the infant may
happen before birth. Recent data demonstrating that the placenta has its own unique microbiome most closely
resembling the oral microbiome suggests a potential hematogenous route by which bacteria can seed the
placenta and the developing fetus. Microbiota from maternal oral, vaginal, urinary tract, and intestine are all
potential sources for these colonizing bacteria. Microbiota from breast milk and maternal contact may be an
important source of commensal bacteria during early infancy and must be considered when studying the
microﬂora of the neonate.

2000; Michalowicz et al. 2006; Macones et al.
2010). Animal models have shown that bacteria
may be spread hematogenously to the placenta
(Han et al. 2004; Fardini et al. 2010), and re-
ports have suggested that oral bacteria may be
associated with pregnancy complications (Katz
et al. 2009; Han et al. 2010; Swati et al. 2012).
Fusobacterium nucleatum is an oral pathogen
that is frequently found in diagnostic cultures
following PTB, PPROM, and stillbirth (Romero
et al. 1989; Watts et al. 1992; Han et al. 2004,
2010; Cahill et al. 2005). Our ﬁnding of Fuso-
bacteria to be a relatively abundant taxon in the
placenta supports the hypothesis of hematoge-
nous spread from the oral cavity to the placenta
(Aagaard et al. 2014), and this theory is further
buttressed by the ﬁnding of bacteria in cord
blood of normal pregnancies (Jime´nez et al.
2005). Along these lines, bacteria can spread
from the intra-amnion outward to the chorion,
which indicates that hematogenous spread from
mother to infant may be occurring via cord

blood (Kim et al. 2009). Thus, hematogenous
spread may promote colonization of the placen-
ta and the fetus, but further studies are needed
to examine this phenomenon. However, a po-
tential mechanism to compromise the ma-
ternal– fetal barrier has been illuminated. In a
mechanism akin to Listeria monocytogenes (Ba-
kardjiev et al. 2006; Le Monnier et al. 2007),
F. nucleatum expresses adhesin FadA that in-
teracts with E-cadherin, which compromises
cell– cell adhesion and membranes (Lecuit et
al. 2004; Ikegami et al. 2009; Fardini et al.
2011). However, further studies are necessary
to show deﬁnitively that hematogenous spread
from the oral cavity is possible for colonization
or infection of the placenta.

Ongoing and future study of the complex
origins of neonatal bacteria should consider
oral and placental microbiomes in addition to
the vaginal microﬂora. This need is exempliﬁed
by studies involving infants born preterm with
early-onset neonatal sepsis showing the pres-

ence of Fusobacterium, Ureaplasma, and Myco-
plasma in the cord blood, amniotic ﬂuid, and
neonatal blood (Wang et al. 2013). Additionally,
neonates with late onset sepsis or necrotizing
enterocolitis have been found to have intestinal
microbial dysbiosis that precedes clinical diag-
nosis (Mai et al. 2011, 2013). Although the vag-
inal microbiome may be implicated in these
neonatal diseases, signiﬁcant differences in
the abundance of placental bacteria have been
found when comparing preterm and term pla-
centas (Jones et al. 2009; Stout et al. 2013; Aa-
gaard et al. 2014). Thus, we speculate that seed-
ing of the neonatal microbiome with bacteria
from the placenta, which arose through hema-
togenous spread, may facilitate early coloniza-
tion. Thus, this early colonization in combina-
tion with variable, modifying host factors (King
et al. 2007; Zeldovich and Bakardjiev 2012) may
conceivably provide the initial seeding of a dys-
biotic microbiome that may render susceptibil-
ity to neonatal disease in a preterm or stressed
infant.

CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL
SIGNIFICANCE

Here we have described the current state of the
science on several aspects of the female repro-
ductive microbiome, as well as their current as-
sociation with perinatal disorders of both the
mother and her offspring. What we understand
today is far more complex and confounded than
was appreciated less than a decade ago, and is
much simpler than what we will come to realize
in coming years. The vaginal microbiome varies
from one woman to the next, across the lifespan,
and in association with both health and disease
states. Simpliﬁed views of “less diversity and less
rich vaginal microbiomes are equivalent to dis-
ease states” have been challenged and discount-
ed, and concepts of clearly delineated CSTs
remain to be fully validated. Previously as-
sumed to be “sterile” reproductive tract tissues
have been shown to harbor low biomass micro-
biomes, and yet we remain unclear as to what,
how and when the infant is colonized. What will
serve as decisive determinants of community
structure is still unknown, and the relative in-

Perinatal Microbiome and Pregnancy

ﬂuence of antibiotics, prebiotics, and probiotics
(as well as early in life diet and exogenous ex-
posures) has yet to be robustly characterized.
A systemic analysis of the microbiome across
the reproductive health spectrum (adolescence,
pregnancy, postnatal and perimenopausal/
menopausal/postmenopausal) will undoubt-
edly shed light on the most signiﬁcant and per-
plexing common disorders of our time. Al-
though this is a challenging area of research,
the advent of metagenomics, combined with
integrative multi’omics, will enable reproduc-
tive scientists and physician scientists to unravel
the mysteries plaguing not only our generations’
health and disease, but will likely shed light on
human and primate coevolution of host and
microbe.
