were  housed  individually  in  plastic  cages 
equipped with a running wheel (Coulbourn 
Instruments,  Whitehall,  PA);  however, 
wheels  were  locked  in  cages  of  seden­
tary mice. Running activity was monitored 
24 hr/day, 7 days/week and analyzed using 
Clocklab  (Actimetrics,  Wilmette,  IL)  and 
Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA) software. 
Mice were allowed to exercise for 5 weeks, 
including 1 week to adapt to running and 
solitary housing.

Mice averaged 10–12 km/24 hr. The aver­
age speed was 1.12 km/hr, and the mean ± SE 
time spent running was 10.3 ± 0.33 hr/day. 
Exercised mice had 30% lower body weight 
on average than sedentary mice. At the end of 
the exercise period, we observed no changes 
in gut transit or stool frequency between the 
two groups. 

PCB exposure. We selected the type of 
PCB congeners and their relative ratio based 
on PCB content in contaminated food (Ashley 
et al. 2000). The three environmentally rele­
vant PCB congeners, PCB138, PCB153, and 
PCB180 (AccuStandard, New Haven, CT), 
were mixed at a molar ratio of 1.7:3.2:1 in 
tocopherol­stripped  safflower  oil  (vehicle; 
Dyets Inc., Bethlehem, PA). The total PCB 
dose of 150 µmol/kg administered to mice 
results in a PCB plasma level of 5 µM (Choi YJ 
et al. 2010), which is comparable to plasma 
levels of PCBs in an acutely exposed human 
population (Jensen 1989; Wassermann et al. 
1979). All treatments were performed via oral 
gavage using an 18­G gavage needle (3 cm 
length, curved, 2.25 mm ball diameter; Popper 
and Sons, New Hyde Park, NY). 

A diagram of the study design is shown 
in Figure 1. At the end of the exercise period, 
mice were administered tocopherol­stripped 
safflower oil to allow them to adjust 
to the vehicle. Feces were collected for 2 days 
(allowing collection of a sufficient amount of 
sample), and samples were analyzed for con­
trol/background microbiome data. Mice were 
then treated with the PCB mixture, and feces 
were again collected for 2 days. To minimize 
the influence of individual variations on the 
gut microbiome, each mouse served as its own 
control for PCB treatment. 

Analysis of the gut microbiome. All analy­
ses were performed using PhyloChip Arrays

(Second Genome Inc., San Bruno, CA). The 
GenBank  accession  numbers  were  used  as 
identification and classification of bacterial 
operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based 
on  their  16S  rRNA  sequences.  Bacterial 
16S rRNAs were amplified with the primer 
sets 27F.1 (5´­AGRG TTTG ATCM TGGC 
TCAG­3´) and 1492R.jgi (5´­GGTT ACCT 
TGTT ACGA CTT­3´). Gene amplification 
was accomplished by polymerase chain reac­
tion (PCR; 35 cycles) as follows: denature 
step  at  95°C  for  30  sec,  annealing  step  at 
50°C for 30 sec, and extension step at 72°C 
for 2 min using the TaKaRa Ex Taq system 
(Takara Bio Inc., Japan). For each sample, 
amplified products were concentrated using 
a centrifuge filtration method and quanti­
fied by electro phoresis using an Agilent 2100 
Bioanalyzer  (Agilent  Technologies,  Santa 
Clara, CA). PhyloChip Control Mix (Second 
Genome Inc.) was added to each amplified 
product. The combined PCR products and 
controls  were  fragmented,  biotin  labeled, 
and hybridized to the PhyloChip Array (ver­
sion  G3).  PhyloChip  arrays  were  washed, 
stained, and scanned using a GeneArray scan­
ner (Affymetrix, Cleveland, OH). Each scan 
was captured using the GeneChip Microarray 
Analysis Suite (Affymetrix). Hybridization 
scores and the fluorescence intensity for each 
taxon  were  calculated  as  a  trimmed  aver­
age,  with  maximum  and  minimum  values 
removed before averaging. 

Statistical  analysis.  Data  processing 
and  multi variate  statistical  analyses  were 
performed  using  the  PhyCA­Stats  analysis 
software  package  (Second  Genome  Inc.). 
Probe  intensities  were  background  sub­
tracted and scaled to values for PhyloChip 
Control  Mix.  Subsequently,  hybridization 
scores  were  calculated  as  log2(mean  probe 
fluorescence intensity) × 1,000. OTUs were 
defined  by  high  16S  rRNA  gene  sequence 
similarity, with most demon strating > 99% 
intra­OTU  concordance.  We  determined 
presence/absence  of  an  OTU  by  a  thresh­
old based on perfect match and mismatch 
intensities of multiple probes per probe set 
(Hazen  et  al  2010).  Before  classification 
analy sis,  we  performed  data  reduction  via 
multiple filtering steps as described by Hazen 
et al.  Taxa­sample intersections were

then calculated using abundance (AT) and 
binary matrices (BT). Pairwise BT and AT 
dissimilarity  scores  were  computed  using 
the Unifrac distance metric (Lozupone et al. 
2006) and weighted Unifrac distance metric, 
respectively; the weighted Unifrac metric con­
siders OTU abundance in addition to phylo­
genetic  distance  between  OTUs.  We  used 
hierarchical clustering via average­neighbor 
(HC­AN) and principal coordinate analysis 
(PCoA) to graphically summarize inter sample 
relationships according to AT and BT dis­
similarity scores. Unsupervised classification 
using the nearest shrunken centroid method 
(Tibshirani et al. 2002) as implemented in 
Prediction  Analysis  of  Microarrays  (PAM; 
http://www­stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/PAM/) 
was  used  to  identify  OTUs  with  the  most 
significant differences in abundance between 
comparison groups. We used a randomiza­
tion/Monte  Carlo  permutation–based  test 
(Adonis test) to determine significant differ­
ences between discrete and continuous vari­
ables. Finally, we employed Welch’s test and 
Student’s  t­test  for  statistical  significance, 
with p < 0.05 considered significant.

Results
PCB exposure decreases the abundance of the 
gut microbiota. We first analyzed the effects 
of PCB exposure on the gut microbiome in 
sedentary  mice.  The  Welch’s  test  revealed 
that  exposure  to  the  PCB  mixture  signifi­
cantly (p < 0.05 by Student’s t­test) altered 
the abundance of 1,223 bacterial taxa in these 
mice (1,133 taxa had decreased abundance 
and 90 taxa had increased abundance). As 
a result of these changes, the overall abun­
dance of bacteria significantly diminished (by 
2.2%) in PCB­exposed mice. Table 1 lists 
bacterial taxa with the greatest decrease in 
abundance after PCB treat­
ment. These taxa belong primarily to phylum 
Proteobacteria, but the classes and families 
are diverse. The group of bacterial taxa with 
increased abundance after PCB treatment was 
relatively modest, and the changes did not 
exceed 2­fold; the bacterial taxa of these with 
the highest increases in abundance are listed 
in Table 2. They belong to several difference 
phyla, including Bacteriodetes, Actinobacteria, 
Verrucomicrobia, and Firmicutes. 

Exposure  to  the  PCB  mixture  did  not 
alter bio diversity of the gut microbiome; all 
11,229 taxa were detected in at least one sam­
ple from sedentary mice. After PCB exposure, 
the number of taxa dropped to 10,798, but 
the change was not statistically significant. 

Exercise alters the composition of the gut 
microbiome. As analyzed by weighted Unifrac 
distance, the structure of the gut micro biome 
of the exercised mice was significantly dif­
ferent  that  of  the  sedentary  mice  (Adonis 
test, p < 0.05). PCoA of unweighted Unifrac

also showed prominent categorization of the 
composition of the gut microbiome between 
the exercised and sedentary mice (Figure 2A). 
Among detected bacterial taxa, 93 were 
present exclusively in either exercised or sed­
entary mice. Specifically, 67 taxa were detected 
only in the exercised mice [see Supplemental 
Material, Table S1 (http://dx.doi.org/10.1289/
ehp.1306534)], and 26 taxa were unique to 
sedentary mice (see Supplemental Material, 
Table S2).

A group of 2,510 taxa showed differences 
in abundance between the exercised and seden­
tary mice. These taxa were then analyzed by 

PCoA with weighted Unifrac distance, which 
indicated significant differences in the compo­
sition of the microbial communities between 
the exercised and sedentary mice (Figure 2B). 
HC­AN analysis based on weighted Unifrac 
distance confirmed a shift of the composition 
of the gut microbiome related to physical activ­
ity (exercised vs. seden tary mice) (Figure 2C).

Further examination using the PAM identi­
fied 10 taxa with substantially different abun­
dance between the exercised and seden tary mice 
(Table 3). The taxa that were more abundant in 
the exercised group were in phylum Firmicutes, 
class Bacilli, and most of these were in order 
Lactobacillales. The taxa that were decreased 

in  the  exercised  group  belonged  to  phyla 
Tenericutes, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes. 
The most striking change in exercised mice 
was a decrease in Erysipelotrichaceae bacterium 
C11_K211 from phylum Tenericutes, which 
decreased dramatically in exercised compared 
with seden tary mice.

Exercise attenuates PCB-induced altera-
tions  of  gut  microbiome  composition. 
Comparison of the gut microbiome among all 
experimental groups (sedentary and exercised 
mice with or without PCB exposure) identi­
fied 1,568 bacterial taxa that were differen­
tially abundant in at least one of these groups. 
Analysis of these taxa for dissimilarity between

Changes in the gut microbiome by exercise and PCBsthe groups using PCoA with weighted Unifrac 
indicated significant differences between the 
composition of the gut microbiome before 
and after PCB exposure in sedentary mice. 
Importantly, exercise altered PCB­mediated 
effects on the gut microbiome, as indicated by 
a loss of bacterial clustering (Figure 3A). This 
phenomenon was subsequently confirmed by 
HC­AN analysis (Figure 3B).

We  detected  10,799  taxa  in  sedentary 
mice exposed to the PCB mixture, compared 
with 13,383 taxa in the exercised mice treated 
with PCBs. Although there appeared to be a 
tendency toward increased biodiversity in the 
exercise­plus­PCB group, these changes were 
not significant. In contrast, the abundance 
of  bacterial  species  was  elevated  by  2.9% 
(Student’s t­test, p < 0.05) in PCB­treated 
exercised  mice  as  compared  PCB­treated 
sedentary  mice,  providing  additional  evi­
dence that exercise can protect against PCB­
mediated alterations in the gut microbiota. As 
shown in Figure 3C, exercise appeared to pre­
vent a PCB­induced decrease in abundance of 
Proteobacteria in sedentary mice (Figure 3C). 

Discussion
In view of recent evidence indicating that gut 
bacteria  can  be  involved  in  the  preabsorp­
tive metabolism of heavy metals and organic 

chemicals (Lapanje et al. 2007; Liebert et al. 
1997; Pinyayev et al. 2011), the gut micro­
biome has been proposed to play a role in 
the  assessment  of  health  risks  associated 
with environ mental chemicals (Betts 2011; 
Snedeker  and  Hay  2012).  Therefore,  our 
demonstration that short­term exposure to an 
environ mentally relevant PCB mixture resulted 
in profound changes in the gut microbiome in 
mice is highly significant. The most striking 
change in the intestinal microbial profiles was 
a decrease in the overall abundance of bac­
terial species. Although these results are the 
first to show effects of PCBs on the gut micro­
biome, the decrease in bacterial abundance we 
observed corresponds with the finding that 
PCB­contaminated soil is characterized by a 
shift in structure and abundance of bacterial 
community (Petric et al. 2011). Incubation of 
soil slurries with higher­chlorinated PCB con­
geners (e.g., PCB28, PCB77, Aroclor 1242) 
has been reported to result in lower bacterial 
numbers (Correa et al. 2010). Even though 
the gut and soil provide completely differ­
ent  bacterial  environments,  PCB  exposure 
appears to elicit environmental stress on the 
structure and composition of bacterial com­
munities that results in diminished bacterial 
abundance. In the present study, these changes 
selectively  affected  bacterial  phylo types  in 

phylum Proteobacteria. Such changes may be 
most rele vant to immune functions of the host, 
because the gut microbiome has been shown to 
play important roles in mucosal immunity and 
interactions with intestinal and colonic epithe­
lial cells, dendritic cells, and T and B immune 
cells. Microbiota composition has functional 
effects on T­effector­ and T­regulatory­cell 
balance, immune responsiveness, and homeo­
stasis (Kelly and Mulder 2012). Thus, it is 
likely that alterations of the gut microbiota 
compromise a novel mechanism leading to 
immunological alterations, which develop in 
response to exposure to PCBs (Maule et al. 
2005; Weisglas­Kuperus et al. 2004). In addi­
tion, alterations of the gut microbiome can 
affect PCB­induced disruption of the intestinal 
barrier and translocation of lipopoly saccharides 
into the blood stream (Choi JJ et al. 2012; 
Choi YJ et al. 2010). In the present study, we 
observed no statistical differences in bacterial 
community structure in the exercised mice 
before and after PCB treatment. Thus, exer­
cise provided protection against PCB­induced 
changes in the gut microbiome. In particular, 
exercise prevented a PCB­induced decrease 
in abundance of Proteobacteria, which was 
observed in seden tary mice.

Although the data we reported here are 
novel, effects of physical activity on several

Choi et al.other aspects of gut physiology (e.g., peri­ 
stalsis; Song et al. 2012) and pathology have 
been  reported.  For  example,  exercise  was 
demonstrated to decrease the risk of develop­ 
ing several intestinal diseases, including colon 
cancer  (Friedenreich  et  al.  2006),  inflam­ 
matory  bowel  disease  and  irritable  bowel 
syndrome (Lustyk et al. 2001), and other dis­ 
orders that are accompanied by changes in 
the gut microbiome (De Hertogh et al. 2012; 
Nelson et al. 2011; Walker et al. 2011). 

The  mechanisms  of  exercise­mediated 
changes  in  gut  ecology  are  not  known; 
however, they are likely to be mediated by 
altering the host factors that influence the 
intestinal micro environment. For example, 
physical activity has been reported to increase 
excretion of primary bile acids to the gastro­ 
intestinal tract (Meissner et al. 2011) and to 
suppress the formation of secondary bile acids 
(Hagio et al. 2010). The primary bile acids, 
such as cholic, deoxycholic, or chenodeoxy­ 
cholic acids, have established anti microbial 
activity, which is mediated by the reduction 
in internal pH levels of bacteria, dissipation 
of their transmembrane electrical potential, 
and disturbances of membrane integrity, lead­ 
ing to leakage of ions and cell death (Kurdi 
et al. 2006). In support of this hypothesis, 
Islam et al. demon strated that cho­ 
lic acid induced substantial changes in the 
cecal microbiome composition by stimu lating 
the growth of Firmicutes at the expense of 
Bacteroidetes and outgrowth of several bacte­ 
ria in the classes Clostridia and Erysipelotrichi. 
Thus, the antimicrobial activity of the bile 
acids may elicit selective pressure on the bacte­ 
rial communities in exercised mice, leading 
to a shift of the gut microbiome structure as 
observed in the present study. 

Short­chain fatty acids (SCFAs) may be 
another factor that regulates the gut micro­ 
biome  in  response  to  exercise.  Indeed, 
Matsumoto et al. showed that rats that 
participated in voluntary running exercise had 
increased butyrate concentration in the cecum 
compared with sedentary rats. These authors 
directly  linked  this  effect  to  the  bene ficial 
effect of exercise on the gut microbiota and 
the development of gastro intestinal disorders. 
SCFAs  (e.g.  butyrate  and  acetate)  increase 
colonic epithelial cell proliferation and decrease 
the risk of colo rectal cancer. Their influence 
on the composition of microbial environment 
has been linked to a decreased pH in the gut 
(Wong et al. 2006). Nevertheless, compared 
with  the  results  of  the  present  study,  the 
effects  of  butyrate  infusion  on  the  rumen 
microbiome  in  cows  was  relatively  minor 
because only 19 genera and 43 bacterial taxa 
were  significantly  affected  in  response  to 
butyrate (Li et al. 2012); these data suggest that 
this SCFA may be only one of several factors 
involved in exercise­mediated changes in the 

gut microbiome. Treatment with SCFAs may 
also affect host­related intestinal factors because 
butyrate  promotes  cell  differentiation  and 
cell­cycle arrest, inhibits the enzyme histone 
deacetylase, and decreases the transformation 
of primary to secondary bile acids as a result of 
colonic acidification (Wong et al. 2006). 

Finally, exercise may influence the com­ 
position of the gut microbiome by altering the 
intestinal immune system. Viloria et al. 
observed that physical activity increased expres­ 
sion of IgA and cytokines such as interleukin­6 
and tumor necrosis factor­α. These changes 
in the intestinal immune system may lead to 
secondary alternations of the host–bacterial 
interaction and induce selective pressure on 
bacterial selection. 

The  development  of  chronic  diseases 
related to the exposure to environmental toxi­ 
cants are associated with age, and the bene­ 
fits of exercise are also being emphasized in 
older  individuals;  therefore,  we  used  aged 
mice   in  the  pres­ 
ent study. Older mice tend to have higher 
body  mass  than  younger  animals.  In  fact, 
the average body weight of sedentary mice 
in the present study was 46.8 ± 1.4 g, and 
body weight of exercised mice was approxi­ 
mately 30% lower. Recent evidence from Ley 
et al. indicated a strong association of 
the intestinal microbiome with the develop­ 
ment of obesity. Genetically obese ob/ob mice 
were charac terized by a major decrease in the 
abundance of Bacteroidetes and an increase 
in Firmicutes compared with lean ob/+ wild­ 
type littermates and lean  ob/+ mothers fed 
the same diets. Similar changes were observed 
in wild­type mice fed a high fat/high poly­ 
saccharide diet (Turnbaugh et al. 2008) and 
in obese humans (Ley et al. 2005). An increase 
in  Firmicutes  (such  as  Lactobacilli)  and  a 
decrease in Bacteroidetes have been confirmed 
in obese humans (Armougom et al. 2009). In 
another study, overweight pregnant patients 
had  reduced  abundance  of  Bifidobacteria 
and Bacteroidetes and increased abundance 
of selected Firmicutes (e.g., Staphylococcus) 
and Proteobacteria (e.g., Enterobacteriaceae) 
(Santacruz et al. 2010). In line with these 
reports,  it  is  relevant  that  we  detected  an 
increased abundance of several Firmicutes, 
primarily Enterococcaceae (e.g., Enterococcus 
faecium), in the exercised mice. 

Although  Enterococci  are  commensal 
bacteria, they are also important nosocomial 
pathogens  that  cause  bacteremia,  endo­ 
carditis, and other infections in humans. Some 
strains are resistant to multiple anti biotics and 
possess  virulence  factors,  such  as  adhesins, 
invasins, pili, and haemolysin (Willems et al. 
2011). Nevertheless, E. faecium isolates from 
clinical outbreaks are different strains than 
E. faecium from animals, food, and humans 
in  the  community  (Franz  et  al.  2011).  In 

fact, several enterococci, including E. faecium 
strains, are used as probiotics in the form of 
pharmaceutical preparations. They are adminis­ 
tered to treat diarrhea, antibiotic­associated 
diarrhea,  and  irritable  bowel  syndrome;  to 
lower cholesterol levels; or to improve host 
immunity (Franz et al. 2011). 

The  most  striking  change  we  found  in 
the gut microbiome of exercised mice was a 
>  300­fold  decrease  in  the  abundance  of 
Erysipelotrichaceae (Table 3). This family plays 
an important role in metabolic disorders and 
energy metabo lism (Chen et al. 2012). Chen 
et al. reported that Erysipelotrichaceae 
were enriched in obese humans and mice, as 
well as in mice fed a high­fat diet, and noted 
that  the  abundance  of  Erysipelotrichaceae 
was  also  increased  in  patients  with  colo­ 
rectal cancer. Thus, our data are consistent 
because we observed a decrease in the num­ 
ber of Erysipelotrichaceae in exercised mice 
that had lost a substantial amount of body 
weight;  this  is  associated  with  the  role  of 
Erysipelotrichaceae in energy production and 
adiposity (Claus et al. 2011; Goodman et al. 
2011; Zhang et al. 2009). 

Conclusions 
Here we demonstrate that oral exposure to a 
mixture of environmentally relevant PCB con­ 
geners significantly altered the abundance of 
the gut microbiome by decreasing the levels of 
Proteobacteria. These results suggest that the 
gut microbiome may be one of the primary 
targets of PCB­induced toxicity in subjects 
exposed orally to these environmental toxi­ 
cants. We observed that PCB­induced altera­ 
tions of the gut microbiome were attenuated 
by voluntary exercise.
