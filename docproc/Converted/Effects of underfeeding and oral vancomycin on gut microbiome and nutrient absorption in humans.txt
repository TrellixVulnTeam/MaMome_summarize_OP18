Inpatient admission after randomization to oral vancomycin (125 mg or placebo four times a day)

Fig. 1 | Study outline. Following screening, participants were admitted and placed on a WMD. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan was 
performed on day 2 and OGTT on day 4 of admission. Participants were then fed (in random order) 50% of WMD (UF) and 150% of WMD (OF) on days 
5–7 and 11–13, with a 3-d washout period in between. Dye marker for stool collection was given on the mornings of days 5, 8, 11 and 14. Collection of food 
(duplicate meals to perform bomb calorimetry) was done on days 5–7 and 11–13. Following the UF/OF phase, participants were on WMD for 2 d then on 
consecutive days underwent OGTT (day 16) measurement of 24-h energy expenditure in a whole-room indirect calorimeter (day 17) and measurement of 
fasting ANGPLT4 and heparin-induced measurement of LPL (day 18). Following this last test, participants were then randomized to oral vancomycin versus 
placebo. On days 23–25 while on WMD, meals were again made in duplicate for bomb calorimetry. Participants again ingested dye marker to mark stool 
on the morning of day 23 before breakfast and again on the morning of day 26. Stool and urine were collected between dye markers for measurement of 
calorie excretion. Whole-room indirect calorimetry for the assessment of the 24-h energy expenditure and substrate oxidation was repeated on day 29; 
heparin-induced measurement of LPL and ANGPTL4 was repeated on day 30. CBC, complete blood count; CH, respiratory chamber ; HPN, heparin bolus;

children15,16. In adults, a 7-d course of oral antibiotics failed to elicit 
any significant differences in stool calorie loss despite widespread 
changes  in  gut  microbial  community  structure  and  function17. 
These  negative  results  are  surprising  given  the  extensive  data  in 
animal  models,  wherein  microbiota  depletion  with  antibiotics  or 
housing under sterile (germ-free) conditions results in marked dif-
ferences in metabolic phenotypes of adult animals6–8.

Taken together, the causal evidence from multiple animal model 
studies  and  largely  correlative  or  retrospective  data  from  human 
cohorts  led  us  to  further  investigate  the  role  of  the  human  gut 
microbiome  in  nutrient  absorption.  We  designed  a  clinical  study 
(ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02037295) to test whether inter-
ventions  designed  to  alter  the  gut  microbiota  cause  significant 
differences  in  stool  calorie  loss,  which  serve  as  an  experimentally 
quantifiable proxy for nutrient absorption. In this two-phase study, 
we directly measured stool and ingested calories along with plasma 
biomarkers  of  host  and  microbial  metabolism  during  overfeeding 
(OF) and UF (phase I) and then in a randomized, double-blind, pla-
cebo-controlled trial with oral vancomycin versus placebo (phase II). 
Previous studies have indicated that oral vancomycin can decrease 
the relative abundance of the Firmicutes phylum while preserving 
Lactobacillaceae18 which has been associated with beneficial meta-
bolic  effects19.  Oral  vancomycin  also  has  minimal  absorption  and 
thus nearly no local or systemic side effects in healthy individuals20.

Results
UF  and  antibiotics  both  impair  nutrient  absorption.  We  con-
ducted a controlled dietary study in two contiguous phases (Fig. 1). 
Individuals were admitted to the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) for 
approximately 31 d (Fig. 1), during which they were fed a weight-
maintaining diet (WMD) (20% kcal protein; 30% kcal fat; 50% kcal 
carbohydrate) adjusted to maintain a stable weight (±1%). In total, 
we screened 51 potential participants, of which 27 initiated and 25 
completed the study (Extended Data Fig. 1). In phase I, participants 

were fed 3 d each of 150% of WMD (OF diet) and 50% of WMD 
(UF diet) with a 3-d washout period in between in random order in 
a cross-over design. In phase II, the same subjects were randomized 
to placebo or oral vancomycin. There were no significant differences 
in the vancomycin versus placebo groups in sex, age, body weight, 
body mass index (BMI), percentage body fat or glucose homeostasis 
(Supplementary Table 1). Participants were inpatients for the entire 
study  and  were  monitored  daily,  and  there  were  no  reported  side 
effects, in particular diarrhea or abdominal symptoms.

Our  results  from  phase  I  demonstrated  that  caloric  intake 
led  to  significant  differences  in  nutrient  absorption.  As  speci-
fied  by  our  study  design,  daily  ingested  calories  were  signifi-
cantly  higher  during  OF  (4,446.5 ± 547.8 kcal d−1)  relative  to  UF 
(1,494.2 ± 211.0 kcal d−1;  Fig.  2a).  On  average,  this  corresponds  to 
a difference of 2,952.3 kcal d−1. Food and stool calories were mea-
sured  by  bomb  calorimetry,  allowing  us  to  calculate  percentage 
calorie  loss  for  each  individual  (100 × (stool  calories/ingested  cal-
ories)).  As  expected,  the  absolute  number  of  calories  lost  per  day 
was significantly higher in overfed relative to underfed individuals 
(257.4 ± 91.2 kcal d−1 versus 123.5 ± 32.4 kcal d−1, Δ = 139.4 kcal d−1, 
P < 0.0001, paired Student’s t-test; Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 
2).  However,  when  expressed  as  percentage  of  ingested  calories 
per  day,  there  was  significantly  greater  stool  calorie  loss  during 
UF relative to OF (8.9 ± 3.7% versus 5.8 ± 1.9%, Δ = 2.3% per day, 
P < 0.0001, paired Student’s t-test; Fig. 2c and Supplementary Table 
2), with a strong and significant intrasubject correlation (Pearson’s 
r = 0.70,  P = 0.004).  Transit  time  was  faster  during  UF  compared 
with  OF  (Δ = −10.6 h,  P = 0.0035,  paired  Student’s  t-test;  Fig.  2d). 
Daily  calorie  loss  from  urine  was  lower  during  UF  versus  OF  in 
absolute  values  (Supplementary  Table  2)  but  was  higher  during 
UF  versus  OF  when  expressed  as  percentage  of  ingested  calories 
(Extended Data Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 2). There was no 
detectable  effect  of  diet  order  or  sex  (all  P > 0.07;  Supplementary 
Table 3).

Two participants did not have available stool measurements during UF. a, Mean of 3-d food intake during OF (n = 25) and UF (n = 25) diets, expressed 
in kilocalories per day. b, Mean stool calories expressed as absolute calorie loss (kcal d−1) during OF (n = 25) and UF (n = 23). c, Mean stool calories

d, Mean transit time, expressed in hours, during OF (n = 25) and UF (n = 23). Δ indicates the mean difference between groups (UF versus OF). P values 
determined by two-sided paired Student’s t-test. Participants who started the dietary phase with OF are represented by red dots, while those who started 
with UF are represented by white dots. The transit time was defined as the time between the first and the last appearance of the dye marker during each 
intervention, in hours.

Next,  we  sought  to  compare  these  results  in  a  parallel  study 
design aimed at directly targeting the gut microbiota. As specified by 
our study design, daily ingested calories were comparable between 
the  placebo  and  vancomycin  groups  (Fig.  3a  and  Supplementary 
Table  2). Vancomycin  led to a significant  increase in  stool calorie 
loss expressed in absolute kilocalories per day (260.1 ± 66.5 kcal d−1 
versus  176.8 ± 79.5 kcal d−1,  Δ = 83.2 kcal d−1,  P = 0.012,  unpaired 
Student’s  t-test;  Fig.  3b)  or  the  percentage  of  ingested  calories 
(8.4 ± 1.9% versus 5.8 ± 2.2%, Δ = 2.6, P = 0.0069, unpaired Student’s 
t-test; Fig. 3c). Importantly, transit time did not differ between van-
comycin and placebo groups (P = 0.2, unpaired Student’s t-test; Fig. 
3d).  In  contrast  to  the  dietary  intervention,  there  was  no  differ-
ence  in  urine  caloric  excretion  between  the  vancomycin  and  pla-
cebo groups (Extended Data Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 2). 
No  differences  were  observed  when  the  analysis  was  stratified  by 
sex (Supplementary Table 4). There was also no absolute change in 
trajectory for body weight in individuals treated with vancomycin 
(Δ = 0.2 kg, P = 0.5, unpaired Student’s t-test). Taken together, these 
results support our hypothesis that both UF and vancomycin result 
in greater stool calorie loss relative to ingested calories (greater per-
centage  of  calories  measured  in  stool),  indicating  a  reduction  in 
nutrient absorption in both states.

Shifts  in  the  gut  microbiome  in  response  to  UF  and  oral  anti-
biotics.  To  identify  candidate  effector  microorganisms  that  could 
contribute  to  the  observed  differences  in  nutrient  absorption,  we 
evaluated  the  impacts  of  dietary  and  pharmacological  perturba-
tions  on  gut  microbial  community  structure  using  a  combination 
of amplicon and metagenomic sequencing. We sequenced samples 

from all 25 participants at key time points during phase I, includ-
ing a baseline sample collected at the beginning of the trial, mid-
point samples collected during each 3-d UF and OF period, samples 
collected pre and post each dietary intervention and three samples 
collected  during  the  vancomycin  or  placebo  arm  (Supplementary 
Table 5). To examine longitudinal changes in gut microbial struc-
ture throughout the study, we also sequenced daily samples during 
phase I (16 d) for ten subjects, including five subjects who showed 
the highest difference in percentage stool calories loss and another 
five subjects who showed the lowest difference in percentage stool 
calories loss between the dietary arms (Supplementary Table 5).

Our nutritional results from phase I (Fig. 2) led us to speculate 
that the gut microbiota may be relatively ‘starved’ of nutrients dur-
ing the UF phase, which would be expected to lead to a decrease in 
bacterial colonization. Surprisingly, we found a significant increase 
in total colonization levels (Fig. 4a) during UF versus OF. These dif-
ferences were still significant after normalizing for stool production 
(P = 0.005,  paired  Wilcoxon  test).  Overall  microbial  community 
structure  was  maintained  throughout  the  3-d  UF  and  OF  inter-
ventions, maintaining the significant interindividual differences at 
baseline (Fig. 4b–d). When analyzed within each subject, we were 
able to identify two individuals (of ten evaluated) that had signifi-
cant differences in overall microbial community structure between 
diet arms (Fig. 4e), which may suggest that the baseline gut micro-
biota matters for its sensitivity to the dietary interventions. Overall 
microbial diversity was also relatively stable throughout the 16 d of 
phase I (Fig. 4f); however, there was significant increase in diver-
sity on the final day of UF relative to the final day of OF (P = 0.04, 
paired  Wilcoxon  test).  There  were  no  significant  differences

in  phylum-  or  genus-level  relative  abundance  between  diet  arms, 
with the exception of the Verrucomicrobia phylum which was sig-
nificantly  increased  during  UF  (Extended  Data  Fig.  3).  At  a  finer 
taxonomic level, we were able to identify four 16S ribosomal RNA 
sequence  variants  that  were  significantly  associated  with  the  diet 
arm (independent of order): A. muciniphila, Bacteroides coprocola, 
a  Lachnospiraceae  sp.  and  a  Ruminoccoccus  sp.  (Fig.  4g).  Taken 
together,  these  results  indicate  the  overall  resiliency  of  the  gut 
microbiota faced with differences in caloric intake while also high-
lighting  a  small  number  of  diet-responsive  bacterial  species  that 
could contribute to the observed differences in nutrient absorption.
Next, we used metagenomic sequencing to confirm and extend 
the  observed  shifts  in  gut  bacterial  relative  abundance.  Samples 
were  selected  from  18  individuals  at  four  key  time  points  includ-
ing a baseline  sample,  midpoint samples  during  each 3-d UF and 
OF period, a sample during the washout period in between and a 
sample during the vancomycin or placebo arm. In total, we gener-
ated 381.7 giga base pairs of sequencing data from the 95 samples 
during  phase  I  (Supplementary  Table  6).  Differentially  abundant 
bacteria  on  each  diet  arm  (independent  of  order)  were  identified 
using  a  paired  Wilcoxon  test.  This  analysis  revealed  nine  bacte-
rial  species  that  were  significantly  different  between  the  two  diet 
arms (Fig. 4h and Supplementary Table 7), including an enrichment 
for A. muciniphila during UF, consistent with our 16S rRNA gene 
sequencing-based  analysis  (Fig.  4g).  We  also  detected  an  enrich-
ment for multiple Alistipes species during UF.

In contrast to caloric intake, the oral antibiotic vancomycin had 
dramatic and reproducible impacts on the gut microbiota relative to 
placebo controls. While colonization level was not different by treat-
ment group (P = 0.26, unpaired Wilcoxon test; Fig. 5a), there was a 
significant decrease in microbial diversity, as assessed by 16S rRNA 
gene  sequencing  (P < 0.0001,  unpaired  Wilcoxon  test;  Fig.  5b). 

Vancomycin  also  had  a  significant  impact  on  gut  microbial  com-
munity structure, outweighing the pre-existing interindividual dif-
ferences (Fig. 5c). Compared with placebo, the vancomycin-treated 
subjects  had  marked  changes  in  phylum-level  relative  abundance 
(Extended  Data  Fig.  4a).  Finer-level  analysis  of  sequence  variants 
demonstrated  several  discrete  clusters  of  bacteria  across  different 
phyla that were altered in the vancomycin-treated group (Extended 
Data Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 8).

Metagenomic sequencing confirmed the broad and reproducible 
differences between the vancomycin and placebo groups. Analysis 
using unpaired Wilcoxon tests revealed 41 bacterial species with a 
significant difference (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05) in relative 
abundance  (Fig.  5d),  with  a  skew  towards  decreased  abundance 
in the vancomycin group (31 decreased, 10 increased). Consistent 
with  our  16S  rRNA  gene  sequencing  data,  these  vancomycin-
depleted  bacteria  spanned  multiple  gram-positive  (Actinobacteria 
and  Firmicutes)  and  gram-negative  (Bacteroidetes)  phyla.  Three 
Veillonella  species21  were  significantly  enriched  in  vancomycin-
treated  individuals.  We  also  detected  an  enrichment  for  multiple 
Lactobacillus  and  Klebsiella  species  in  the  vancomycin  group,  in 
addition  to  a  virulent  bacteriophage  that  infects  lactobacilli  (Lc-
Nu)22,  consistent  with  evidence  in  mouse  models  that  antibiotics 
induce phage production23.

Despite increased stool calorie loss with both UF versus OF and 
vancomycin  versus  placebo,  we  found  markedly  different  effects  of 
these interventions on the gut microbiota. UF and OF produced little 
perturbation at the phylum or finer levels, while vancomycin resulted 
in widespread changes in gut microbial community structure. Despite 
these differences, we were able to identify two bacterial species that 
consistently changed in response to both perturbations (Fig. 5e) based 
on  16S  rRNA  sequence  variants  analysis:  A.  muciniphila,  a  mucin-
degrading  bacterium  with  a  putative  role  in  preserving  gut  barrier

cin group, and an unidentified species belonging to Lachnospiraceae 
NK4A136 group, which decreased during UF and vancomycin inter-
ventions. Metagenomic sequencing confirmed the enrichment for A. 
muciniphila  during  UF  (Fig.  4h),  and  a  trend  towards  increased  A. 
muciniphila abundance in the vancomycin group (P = 0.25).

Mechanistic insights into host–microbiome interactions relevant 
to  metabolic  disease  in  UF  versus  OF  and  vancomycin  versus 
placebo  interventions.  To  gain  further  insight  into  the  specific 
bacterial  genes,  enzymes  and  metabolic  pathways  associated  with 
nutrient absorption, we annotated our metagenomic datasets using 
HUMAnN2 (ref.  27). Consistent with our taxonomic analyses (Fig. 
4), which revealed modest perturbation of gut microbial commu-
nity structure with UF versus OF, functional profiling of the micro-
biome  datasets  did  not  reveal  any  significant  differences  in  gene 
family  or  metabolic  pathway  abundance  between  the  diet  arms. 
In  contrast,  we  found  significant  differences  in  the  abundance  of 
760 of a total of 3,553 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 
(KEGG)  functional  orthologs  (KEGG  Orthology)  (FDR < 0.1, 
Supplementary  Table  9)  between  vancomycin  and  placebo,  con-
sistent  with  the  widespread  changes  in  gut  microbial  community 
structure (Fig. 5a–d). At the pathway level there was a more modest 
difference between groups; only 3 of 290 metabolic pathways were 
differentially abundant (all decreased) with vancomycin compared 
with placebo (Extended Data Fig. 5). Interestingly, two of the three 
significant  pathways  (pyruvate  fermentation  to  butanoate  and  the 
superpathway of Clostridium acetobutylicum acidogenic fermenta-
tion) were related to the fermentation of sugars to the major short-
chain  fatty  acid  butyrate  (aka  butanoate),  suggesting  that  there 
could  be  reduced  butyrate  production  or  bacterial  metabolism  by 
the gut microbiota during vancomycin treatment.

To  provide  more  direct  support  for  the  inferred  differences  in 
gut  microbial  metabolism,  we  evaluated  plasma  short-chain  fatty 
acids as markers of the ability of the gut microbiome to process and 
metabolize nutrients, together with hormones and bile acids impli-
cated in nutrient absorption and gut barrier function. These mea-
surements were performed before and following each intervention. 
Consistent  with  earlier  studies28–33,  GLP-1  and  leptin  significantly 
increased during OF and leptin and GLP-2 significantly decreased 
during UF (Supplementary Table 10). Butyrate, a major end-prod-
uct of gut bacterial metabolism, was significantly decreased follow-
ing  both  UF  (Fig.  6a)  and  vancomycin  (Fig.  6b),  supporting  our 
metagenomic analyses and consistent with a decrease in the capac-
ity of the gut microbiome to harvest nutrients during these inter-
ventions. Deoxycholic acid, a secondary bile acid, also significantly 
decreased following both interventions (Fig. 6c,d). Elevated deoxy-
cholic  acid  has  been  implicated  in  increased  gut  permeability34. 
Lower concentrations may imply preservation of the gut barrier and 
lower nutrient absorption. Vancomycin also decreased acetate, pro-
pionate and the secondary bile acid lithocholic acid (Extended Data 

Fig. 6), consistent with the broad impact of this oral antibiotic on 
the gut microbiome.

Increased stool calorie loss might be due to improved gut bar-
rier  function,  thereby  decreasing  gut  permeability.  We  measured 
two  circulating  plasma  markers  that  when  increased  may  signify 
increased  gut  permeability:  zonulin,  a  modulator  of  intercellular 
tight junctions35; and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a product of gram-
negative  bacteria36.  There  were  no  changes  in  plasma  zonulin  or 
LPS concentrations with UF (Supplementary Table 10). During OF, 
plasma  zonulin  concentration  increased  (Δ = 0.4,  P = 0.04,  paired 
Student’s  t-test)  but  there  was  no  change  in  plasma  LPS  concen-
trations.  Plasma  LPS  and  zonulin  concentrations  did  not  change 
during  vancomycin  or  placebo  administration.  Except  for  a  slight 
increase in zonulin with OF, we did not find evidence of altered gut 
permeability. Lastly, we evaluated whether vancomycin administra-
tion affected energy or substrate oxidation rates or metabolites that 
regulate fat storage and glucose metabolism. There were no signifi-
cant differences in (1) angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) or lipopro-
tein lipase activity (LPL) (Supplementary Table 11); (2) 24-h energy 
expenditure  or  substrate  oxidation  (Extended  Data  Fig.  7);  or  (3) 
glucose tolerance or insulin concentrations (Extended Data Fig. 8).

Discussion
In  this  two-phase  study  we  directly  measured  ingested  and  stool 
calories, demonstrating an increased and comparable stool calorie 
loss relative to ingested calories during two states: UF versus OF and 
oral vancomycin versus placebo. This increase in stool calorie loss 
during UF and vancomycin administration occurred despite differ-
ent effects on the gut microbiota. We saw a modest perturbation of 
gut microbial community structure with UF versus OF, while oral 
vancomycin  induced  widespread  changes  with  reduced  diversity 
and marked shifts in gut bacterial relative abundances. Decreased 
plasma butyrate and deoxycholic acid concentrations were common 
to  both  interventions  that  induced  greater  stool  calorie  loss.  Our 
study  employs  direct  measurements  of  ingested,  stool  and  urine 
calories and close monitoring of and consistency of dietary intake, 
through the critical periods of stool collection. As participants were 
inpatients, provided stool samples were timed so that we were able 
to analyze gut bacterial abundance concurrent with interventions.

As a major end-product of bacterial metabolism, plasma butyr-
ate  is  a  marker  of  the  availability  or  ability  of  the  gut  microbiota 
to  process  nutrients37.  Given  this,  our  results  indicate  that  either 
decreased calorie delivery to the microbiome, as in the case of UF, 
or widespread changes in its structure, due to oral vancomycin, limit 
microbiome nutrient harvesting capacity, resulting in increased stool 
calorie loss. This offers evidence based on directly measured calories, 
in  the  form  of  stool  calorie  measurement  accounting  for  ingested 
calories, that in humans the gut microbiome has a measurable role 
in metabolizing nutrients. Based on our results, we would estimate 
that the gut microbiome harvested an additional ~2.5% of absolute 
ingested calories under the conditions used for our study cohort.

nutrient  absorption.  Our  current  study  differs  by  more  carefully 
controlling OF and UF by systematically providing diets that were 
50%  or  150%  of  participants’  weight-maintaining  needs.  We  con-
firmed and quantified the effect of UF on increasing relative stool 
calorie loss. However, in contrast to our previous results, we did not 
observe significant changes at the phylum level. The difference in 

our  current  study  may  have  been  due  to  the  more  carefully  con-
trolled dietary conditions, with each participant receiving the exact 
same foods for each 3-d OF and UF period, indicating that factors 
other than calorie load (for example, differing meal content) may 
have led to our previously observed changes in phylum-level bacte-
rial relative abundance.

measurements of butyrate and/or deoxycholic acid concentrations.

Our results also differ from another carefully conducted study17 
that  did  not  find  an  effect  of  oral  vancomycin  on  stool  calories 
despite widespread changes in gut microbial community structure 
and  metabolite  concentrations.  We  carefully  controlled  ingested 
calories,  with  both  placebo  and  vancomycin  groups  receiving  the 
exact same meals. By measuring ingested calories, we were able to 
calculate percentage of stool calories absorbed. This is important, 
as  labeled  calories  reflect  ‘metabolizable’  calories  whose  accuracy 
is problematic for careful energy balance studies such as these38–41. 
Nevertheless,  we  found  differences  in  both  absolute  and  percent-
age  stool  calories.  The  difference  in  actual  calories  of  ~80 kcal d−1 
appears to be comparable to the difference in stool calories between 
placebo and vancomycin groups in the study by Reijnders et al.17.

Our  results  provide  insights  into  potential  mechanisms  that 
could explain the increased stool calories loss. Both perturbations 
(UF and vancomycin) resulted in a significant increase in the rela-
tive abundance of A. muciniphila, which is recognized for its ability 
to forage on host mucins42. In mice, A. muciniphila counteracts the 
effect of the decrease in mucous layer thickness produced by a high-
fat diet26, producing weight loss without changes in food intake. A. 
muciniphila increases turnover of the mucous layer preventing dis-
ruption of tight junctions, which may reduce gut permeability43,44. 
In  humans,  a  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  pilot 
study revealed a trend towards decreased body weight and fat mass 

in  response  to  A.  muciniphila  supplementation45.  Administration 
of  pasteurized  A.  muciniphila  cells45  in  this  study  increased  stool 
energy content, consistent with our results. Additional studies are 
warranted to elucidate the role and mechanisms of A. muciniphila 
in nutrient absorption.

Both perturbations led to a significant decrease in plasma butyrate 
and deoxycholic acid concentrations, consistent with earlier studies17. 
These  two  compounds  play  opposing  roles  in  the  gastrointestinal 
tract,  affecting  gut  barrier  function  and  modifying  epithelial  layer 
nutrient  permeability.  In  vitro,  deoxycholic  acid  reduces  both  the 
tight junction protein zonula occludens-1 and mucin-producing gob-
let cells and increases intestinal macrophage polarization, suggesting 
that deoxycholic acid interferes with intestinal barrier function and 
induces  intestinal  inflammation34.  Butyrate,  on  the  other  hand,  has 
a salutary effect on gut barrier function46. In vitro studies show that 
butyrate and other short-chain fatty acids stimulate intestinal barrier 
formation, inducing protection against disruption from LPSs47. Our 
observations suggest that caloric intake and antibiotics may disrupt 
the balance between these, and likely other, microbial metabolites that 
regulate barrier function, resulting in altered nutrient absorption.

We  evaluated  alternative  mechanisms  that  could  explain  the 
observed  differences  in  nutrient  absorption.  We  did  not  find  evi-
dence  that  circulating  markers  of  gut  permeability  (plasma  LPS36 
and zonulin35,48,49) decreased with interventions that led to reduced

by  colonic  transit  time,  which  was  more  rapid  with  UF.  In  rats,  a 
reduced  transit  time  increases  fecal  volume  and  suppresses  fat 
absorption50.  During  isocaloric  diets  of  similar  macronutrient  but 
differing fiber content, high-fiber (expected to increase stool calorie 
loss) decreases transit time compared with low-fiber diets51. For UF, 
more rapid transit could have decreased contact time with gut epi-
thelium, decreasing absorption.

We  do  acknowledge  several  limitations.  Our  sample  size  was 
small, yet in this carefully controlled inpatient study we had a diverse 
participant population. The study was powered to detect differences 
in stool calorie excretion between UF and OF and vancomycin ver-
sus placebo. Thus, we lacked power to detect associations between 
the gut microbiota and stool calorie loss. Also, we acknowledge that 
a direct causal role for the bacterial species, genes and metabolites 
associated with energy harvest needs to be tested in animal models 
and controlled human intervention studies.

The UF and OF periods were only 3 d, and it is possible that more 
dramatic shifts in the gut microbiota might occur with more pro-
longed dietary interventions. Oral vancomycin was the only antibi-
otic tested, so we do not know whether other antibiotics might have 
an effect on stool calories using our study design. We also did not 
have stool samples or dietary records before admission to determine 
how different our study diets were to free-living diets. Any proposed 
mechanisms regarding nutrient absorption were inferred as we are 
not able to directly assess nutrient transit across the intestine.

The  functional  role  of  the  human  gut  microbiome  in  nutrient 
absorption remains a topic of intense interest in the field of energy 
balance. In our study, both calorie restriction and oral vancomycin 
led to increased stool calorie loss and lower levels of plasma butyr-
ate. The magnitude of this effect is ~2.5% of ingested calories, which 
would translate to a ~1.2-kg weight loss in a 100-kg subject over 1 yr 
(ref. 52). By limiting nutrient availability to the microbiome by calo-
rie restriction or altering the ability of the microbiome to metabo-
lize calories by widespread change in community structure, our data 
provide evidence for a causal role for the human gut microbiome in 
nutrient metabolism.

Study volunteers. From March of 2014 to May of 2017, 51 individuals aged 
18–45 yr were recruited from the greater Phoenix area. Of these, 27 met initial 
inclusion criteria and were admitted to our CRU. Participants were fully informed 
of the study and signed consent forms before any study procedures. Except for 
impaired glucose tolerance and obesity, all participants were deemed healthy 
by medical history, physical exam and laboratory testing (see inclusion criteria 
and exclusion criteria below). The experimental protocol was approved by the 
Institutional Review Board of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and 
Kidney Diseases.

Inclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria were as follows: free of acute and chronic 
diseases (especially gastrointestinal disorders) as determined by medical history, 
physical examination and laboratory tests; no laxative drugs within 3 weeks 
of admission; and age 18–45 yr (to minimize the effect of aging on nutrient 
absorption).

Exclusion criteria. Specific exclusion criteria included use of antibiotics or 
probiotics within 3 months and history of lactose intolerance. During the 
initial part of the inpatient admission, participants were tested for stool occult 
blood, stool ova and parasites, and celiac disease (total immunoglobulin A 
and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies). We excluded volunteers with 
chronic diseases or current substance abuse and subjects with a history or 
clinical manifestation of: current smoking; type 2 diabetes (according to the 
World Health Organization diagnostic criteria); endocrine disorders, such as 
Cushing’s disease, pituitary disorders, and hypo- and hyperthyroidism; HIV 
infection (self-report), due to effects on weight and body composition of HIV 
and medications used to treat HIV; active tuberculosis (self-report); asthma 
on active daily treatment with medications; pulmonary disorders, including 
physician-diagnosed chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and obstructive 
sleep apnea syndrome; cardiovascular diseases, including coronary heart disease, 
heart failure, arrhythmias and peripheral artery disease; hypertension (according 
to the World Health Organization diagnostic criteria), treated or uncontrolled; 
and gastrointestinal diseases, including inflammatory bowel diseases (for 
example, Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis), malabsorption syndromes (for 
example, celiac disease), gastric ulcer (active) and irritable bowel syndrome. All 
participants had negative testing during admission for anti-tissue transglutaminase 
antibodies and stool blood. Additional exclusions included: lactose intolerance 
by medical history; anemia (defined as hemoglobin < 11 mg dl−1), leucopenia 
(defined as white blood cell count < 4,000 µl−1) or thrombocytopenia (defined 
as platelet count < 150,000 µl−1); liver disease, including nonalcoholic fatty liver 
disease or current elevated liver enzymes over 1.5× the normal range for aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or gamma-glutamyl 
transferase (GGT); evidence of chronic renal disease as defined by estimated 
glomerular filtration rate of <60 ml min−1 or evidence of overt proteinuria on 
urine dipstick; central nervous system disease, including previous history of 
cerebrovascular accidents, dementia and neurodegenerative disorders; cancer 
requiring treatment in the past 5 yr, except for nonmelanoma skin cancers or 
cancers that have clearly been cured or in the opinion of the investigator carry 
an excellent prognosis; behavioral or psychiatric conditions that would be 
incompatible with a safe and successful participation in the study (such as major 
depression, schizophrenia and presence of psychotic symptoms); eating disorders 
such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia or binge eating syndrome; taking weight-loss 
drugs; weight change of more than 5% of total body weight in the 3 months before 
admission; use of any antibiotic or probiotic agents within 6 months before the 
study, to minimize the potential effects of these substances on the gut microbiota; 
use of antacids (proton pump inhibitors, H2 antagonists or aluminum/magnesium 
hydroxide) 3 months before the study assessed by self-report; and evidence of 
alcohol and/or drug abuse (more than three drinks per day and use of drugs, such 
as amphetamines, cocaine, heroin or marijuana). Finally, we excluded subjects with 
known allergies to vancomycin, known allergies to heparin or a history of heparin-
induced thrombocytopenia, or a personal history or evidence of a bleeding 
disorder.

Study design and randomization. This was a controlled dietary study 
conducted in two contiguous phases. Numbered randomization lists for diet 
and pharmacologic interventions by sex were generated before start of study by 
statistician and participants were assigned by enrollment (for example, Male no. 
1, Male no. 2, Female no. 1, Female no. 2 and so on). The first phase was a cross-
over design in which all participants underwent in random order 3 d of OF and 
UF, followed by a second phase involving double-blind, randomized, placebo-
controlled assignment to administration of oral vancomycin or matching placebo. 
Individuals were admitted to the CRU for approximately 31 d (Fig. 1). Throughout 
the study, subjects were fed a WMD (20%, 30% and 50% of daily calories were 
provided as protein, fat and carbohydrate, respectively). This was based on unit-
specific equations specific to our CRU that include weight, BMI and sex53. Morning 
weight was checked daily, and the calories were adjusted as necessary throughout 
the stay to maintain a stable weight (±1%). Participants were required to consume 
all provided food during the study. Total-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 

NATURE MEDiciNE | www.nature.com/naturemedicine

(Lunar Prodigy, enCORE 2003 software version 7.53.002, GE Lunar) to assess body 
composition was performed on day 2. A 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) 
was done on day 4 to identify individuals with diabetes54. Starting on day 5, 
participants were fed in random order (permuted block randomization by sex with 
a block size ranging from 1 to 5) 50% (UF) and 150% (OF) of their WMD each 
separated by 3 d of WMD. For the UF and OF diets, the same exact menus (same 
foods) were given in the same order over the 3-d period, only varying in calorie 
content (Supplementary Table 12). Fasting blood samples were collected before 
and following the UF and OF diets. Urine was collected during each 3-d period. 
To mark stool related to each diet, a tasteless, nonabsorbable, blue dye (FD&C 
250 mg) was given to the participant just before breakfast on day 1 of each UF and 
OF diet and just before breakfast on the day following each OF and UF diet. Stool 
for calorie measurement was collected from appearance of the first dye marker 
(dyed stool included) until appearance of the second one (dyed stool excluded). 
Following the UF and OF phase, participants were placed back on WMD. After 3 d 
back on WMD, they underwent an OGTT, followed the next day by measurement 
of 24 h energy expenditure and substrate use in a whole-room indirect calorimeter.

After exiting the calorimeter and while fasting, an intravenous bolus of 
75 IU kg–1 heparin was administered and, 15 min after the bolus, blood was 
collected for measurement of LPL and ANGPTL4. Volunteers were then 
randomly assigned to receive either vancomycin 125 mg orally four times a day or 
identical placebo pills for 14 d. The randomization and release of the medication 
were managed by the pharmacy at the Phoenix Indian Medical Center using a 
permuted block randomization by sex, with a block size ranging from 1 to 5. The 
experimental design is shown in Fig. 1. Fasting blood samples were obtained on 
randomization day (day 18) and following the treatment period (day 31). After 
5 d on vancomycin or placebo, stool calorie measurements were again collected 
over 3 d while patients continued WMD. Following this, the OGTT, 24-h energy 
expenditure, LPL and ANGPTL4 measures were repeated.

Calorie measurement of food, urine and stool by bomb calorimetry. Volunteers 
ate under supervision and consumed at least 95% of the provided food. During 
each 3-d period of determination of stool, urine and food calories, meals were 
prepared in duplicate and one given at random to the participant. The duplicate 
meal was then used for direct determination of calories. Calories in food, urine 
and stool were measured as previously described5. Briefly, stool samples were 
collected from appearance of the first marker to appearance of the second marker 
and weighed. An aliquot of stool was then mixed with distilled water equal 
to weight of the fecal aliquot. This was then homogenized and lyophilized55. 
Similarly, food samples were made into a slurry and were lyophilized. Urine 
samples were directly lyophilized. Lyophilization was performed at −77 °C using 
a Freezemobile12XL instrument (VirTis). Following this, ~1-g pellets were made 
from (PARR Instrument Co) dried stool, food and urine. Energy content of pellets 
was measured using bomb calorimetry using the Isoperibol Calorimeter 6200 
instrument with a 1108 Oxygen Bomb model (PARR Instrument Co). Samples 
were run in duplicate and results averaged. If duplicate samples were >40 cal apart, 
calorimetry was repeated until duplicate samples were <40 cal apart or the mean of 
four consecutive readings was used. Benzoic acid standards were measured every 
20 burns for standardization. The calorie loss from stool or urine was calculated 
as kilocalories per day and as percentage calories of ingested food ((stool calories/
ingested calories) × 100)). Transit time was calculated as the difference between the 
appearance of the first dye marker and the appearance of the second dye marker 
during each period of stool collection.

Energy expenditure and macronutrient oxidation. Twenty-four-hour 
energy expenditure was measured by whole-room indirect calorimetry as 
previously described56. Briefly, participants entered the chamber after breakfast 
then stayed inside for ~23.5 h. The air temperature was maintained at 23 °C. 
Meals were provided through an airtight interlock at 11:00, 16:00 and 19:00. 
Spontaneous physical activity was continuously monitored by a radar system 
based on the Doppler effect. The flow rate through the chamber and the CO2 
and O2 concentrations of the out-flowing air were continuously monitored and 
calculations of oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production and respiratory 
quotient were made every minute. Calculation of energy expenditure and 
substrate oxidation was performed using the equations of Lusk57. Sleeping energy 
expenditure was determined between 23:30 and 5:00 when spontaneous physical 
activity (SPA) was <1.5%. All measures were extrapolated to 24 h.

Biochemical analyses for plasma variables. Leptin was measured using the 
human leptin Quantikine ELISA kit from R&D Systems. The inter- and intra-
assay coefficient of variation (%CV) values were 1.58 and 1.34, respectively. 
Active GLP-1 was measured using the Version2 Multi Array Assay kit from 
Mesoscale Discovery. The inter-assay and intra-assay %CV values were 3.99 and 
2.89, respectively. GLP-2 was measured using the GLP-2 ELISA kit from EMD 
Millipore. The inter- and intra-assay %CV values were 3.33 and 2.80, respectively. 
Plasma ANGPLT4 was measured using the sandwich ELISA from BioVendor. The 
intra-assay %CV was 1.58 and the inter-assay %CV was 4.46. The LPL activity 
was measured using the assay kit from ROAR Biomedical. The intra-assay %CV 
was 1.83. Plasma short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were performed in duplicate 

ArticlesNature MediciNeon a Waters Acquity UPLC-Thermo QExactive high-resolution/accurate mass 
spectrometer. Plasma primary and secondary bile acid concentrations were 
measured using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis 
performed in duplicate on a Thermo Vanquish UPLC-Thermo Altis triple-
quadrupole mass spectrometer. Plasma glucose was measured by the glucose 
oxidase method (Beckman Instruments or GM9 Glucose Analyzer, Analox 
Instruments). Fasting insulin concentrations were assessed using an automated 
immunoenzymometric assay (Tosoh Bioscience). LPS and zonulin were measured 
using an assay from CusaBio Technologies. The LPS intra-assay %CV was 6.77 and 
the inter-assay %CV was 9.9. The zonulin intra-assay %CV was 5.46 and the inter-
assay %CV was 5.87.

Power calculation. Power was based on two primary outcomes, the difference 
in stool calories between UF and OF and the difference in stool calories between 
vancomycin and placebo. Based on our previous studies5, 24 individuals gave us a 
power of 0.86 at an alpha of 0.05 to detect at least a 1.3 ± 1.9% per day (mean ± s.d.) 
difference in stool calories between UF and OF. For the vancomycin versus 
placebo, 12 subjects per group gave us a power of 0.95 at an alpha of 0.05 to detect 
a 75 ± 49 kcal d−1 (mean ± s.d.) difference in stool calories.

Quantification of bacterial load. DNA templates were diluted 100-fold before 
quantitative PCR (qPCR) of 16S rRNA gene copies was performed. qPCR was 
carried out in triplicate 10-μl reactions with 200 nM 340 F (forward)/514 R 
(reverse) primers using a BioRad CFX384 thermocycler with SYBRSelect for CFX 
Master Mix (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and 
an annealing temperature of 60 °C. Absolute quantifications were determined 
against a standard curve of purified bacterial DNA. Mean values of triplicate 
reactions were taken for further downstream analyses. Absolute bacterial 
abundance was derived by adjustments for dilutions during DNA extraction, 
normalization and PCR reaction preparation, dividing by the total fecal mass used 
for DNA extraction in grams.

16S rRNA gene sequencing and analysis. Stool samples were collected daily and 
immediately frozen at −70 °C until processing. Stool samples were homogenized 
with bead beating for 5 min (Mini-Beadbeater-96, BioSpec) using the ZR 
BashingBead lysis matrix containing 0.1- and 0.5-mm beads (ZR-96 BashingBead 
Lysis Rack, Zymo Research) and the lysis solution provided in the ZymoBIOMICS 
96 MagBead DNA Kit (Zymo Research). The samples were then centrifuged for 
5 min at 3,000g and the supernatant was transferred to 1-ml deep-well plates. 
The DNA was then purified using the ZymoBIOMICS 96 MagBead DNA Kit 
(Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Using a previously 
published protocol and primers, 16S rRNA gene PCR was carried out 58. Amplicons 
were pooled and normalized using the SequalPrep Normalization Plate Kit 
(Invitrogen). The normalized amplicon pool was concentrated down to ~100 μl 
in a SpeedVac and then purified using 1× AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter). 
Libraries were quantified using the KAPA Library Quantification Kit (Illumina) 
and sequenced using 2 × 250-base pair paired-end sequencing (Illumina MiSeq) 
with 15% PhiX spike-in. Demultiplexed reads were processed using QIIME2 (ref. 59)  
with denoising by DADA2 (ref. 60). Taxonomy was assigned using the DADA2 
implementation of the RDP classifier61 using the DADA2-formatted training sets 
for SILVA128 (benjjneb.github.io/dada2/assign.html). A phylogenetic tree was 
constructed via fragment insertion in QIIME2 (qiime fragment-insertion sepp). 
Sequence variants were filtered such that they were present in more than one 
sample with a total of at least 10 reads and a relative abundance of at least 0.0001 
(0.01%) across the dataset. Samples with lower total read count than template 
control were discarded. Diversity metrics were generated using Vegan62 with 
principal coordinate analysis carried out with APE63. Differential abundance 
analysis of sequence variants was carried out using DESeq2 (ref. 64). Significant 
sequence variants (FDR < 0.05) were visualized on a phylogenetic tree using 
ggtree65.

Metagenomic sequencing and analysis. For a subset of samples that were 
subjected to 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, the same DNA extracts were 
subjected to shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Whole-genome shotgun libraries 
were prepared using the Nextera DNA Flex Library Preparation Kit (Illumina) 
with the Nextera DNA Unique Dual Indexes and sequenced on the NovaSeq S2 
platform as 2 × 100-base pair paired-end reads. Raw Illumina reads underwent 
quality trimming and adaptor removal using Fastp66 and host read removal by 
mapping to the human genome (GRCh38) with Bowtie2 (ref. 67). Metagenomic 
samples were taxonomically profiled using MetaPhlan2 (ref. 68) and functionally 
profiled using HUMAnN2 v0.11.1 (ref. 69), both with default parameters. Species 
from taxonomic profiles were retained for further analysis if their mean relative 
abundance exceeded 0.0001 (0.01%) across the dataset with nonzero abundances in 
at least two samples. Tables of pathway and gene family abundance obtained using 
HUMAnN2 were normalized to copies per million using ‘humann2_renorm_table 
-units cpm’, including unmapped and unintegrated read mass. Pathway abundance 
files were joined into one abundance table and filtered to contain the pathways 
with top 75% mean abundance (final n = 290 pathways). Gene family files were 
regrouped using the humann2_regroup_table command with the ‘uniref90_ko’ 

term to KEGG Orthology groups of functional orthologs70, thereby reducing 
the number of low-abundance variables and number of tests to be performed 
downstream. Regrouped, per-sample KEGG Orthology abundance profiles were 
joined into one abundance table and filtered to contain features with top 75% mean 
abundance (final n = 3,553 KEGG Orthology groups). Differential abundance 
analyses of pathways and KEGG Orthology groups were carried out using 
Wilcoxon test with multiple testing correction via FDR estimation across features 
tested.

Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using the procedures of 
SAS, v.9.2 (SAS Institute). Normally distributed data are presented as mean ± s.d.; 
data that deviated from normality are presented as median and 95% confidence 
interval. To fit linear regression models, skewed variables were log10 transformed 
to approach a normal distribution assessed by tests for normality. Pearson or 
Spearman (for non-normally distributed variables) correlation was used to test 
associations between variables. In OF versus UF, changes in stool and urine calories 
expressed as total and percentage of ingested calories, hormones and short-chain 
fatty acids were compared by paired Student’s t-test. In the vancomycin versus 
placebo phase, the same variables were compared using an unpaired Student’s 
t-test. Changes in energy expenditure and substrate oxidation before and after 
vancomycin and placebo were evaluated by analysis of covariance accounting for 
baseline values. For energy expenditure and substrate oxidation measures, models 
included adjustment for baseline fat-free mass (FFM), fat mass (FM), age, race and 
sex. Mixed models using a first-order autoregressive covariance structure were 
used to analyze weight trajectory during the inpatient stay. Glucose area under 
the curve and insulin area under the curve were calculated using the trapezoidal 
method. Paired and unpaired Wilcoxon tests were used to compare changes in the 
relative abundance of taxonomic (phyla, species) and functional (pathways, KEGG 
Orthology groups) features for UF versus OF and vancomycin versus placebo, 
respectively. Bacterial load was calculated as number of 16S rRNA gene copies 
per gram of feces. Shannon diversity index was used to determine the microbial 
diversity between interventions. Bray–Curtis dissimilarity was used to quantify 
compositional dissimilarity between microbial communities and the distance 
matrix was analyzed using Adonis PERMANOVA (R Vegan package) with 10,000 
replications.

Data collection

The first phase was a cross-over design in which all participants underwent in random order 3 days of over and underfeeding, followed by 
a second phase involving double blind randomized placebo-controlled assignment to administration of oral vancomycin or matching 
placebo. Participants were fed in random order 50% (UF) and 150% (OF) of their weight maintaining diet each separated by 3 days of 
WMD and volunteers were then randomly assigned to either receive vancomycin 125 mg orally four times a day or identical placebo pills 
for 14 days. 

uring each 3-day period of determination of stool. Stool samples were collected from appearance of first marker to appearance of the 

second marker and weighed during under- or overfeeding and after randomization to vancomycin.

Data analysis

Statistical analyses were performed using the procedures of SAS, version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).   

tool samples were collected from appearance of first marker to appearance of the second marker and weighed.  An aliquot of stool was 
then mixed with distilled water equal to weight of the fecal aliquot. This was then homogenized and lyophilized 22. Similarly, food 
samples were made into a slurry and were lyophilized. Urine samples were directly lyophilized. Lyophilization was performed at −77°C 
using a Freezemobile12XL instrument (Virtis, Gardiner, NY). Following this, ~1 gram pellets were made from (PARR Instrument Co, 
Moline, IL) dried stool, food and urine.   
Energy content of pellets was measured using bomb calorimetry using the Isoperibol Calorimeter 6200 instrument with a 1108 oxygen 
bomb model (PARR Instrument Co, Moline, IL). Samples were run in duplicate and results averaged. If duplicate samples were >40 
calories apart, calorimetry was repeated until duplicate samples were <40 calories or the mean of 4 consecutive readings was used. 
Benzoic acid standards were measured every 20 burns for standardization.   

unar Prodigy, enCORE 2003 software version 7.53.002, GE Lunar, Madison, WI, USA was used to assess total-body dual-energy X-ray 
absorptiometry (DXA) on day 2 of the study

Analysis of gut microbiota 
16S rRNA Gene Sequencing and Analysis 
Stool samples were collected daily and immediately frozen at -70°C until processed. Stool samples were homogenized with bead beating 
for 5 min (Mini-Beadbeater-96, BioSpec) using the ZR BashingBead lysis matrix containing 0.1 and 0.5 mm beads (ZR-96 BashingBead 
Lysis Rack, Zymo Research) and the lysis solution provided in the ZymoBIOMICS 96 MagBead DNA Kit (Zymo Research). The samples were 
then centrifuged for 5 min at 3,000 g and the supernatant was transferred to 1mL deep-well plates. The DNA was then purified using the 
ZymoBIOMICS 96 MagBead DNA Kit (Zymo Research) according to manufacturer’s instructions. 16S rRNA gene PCR was carried out as per 
reference protocol and primers. Amplicons were pooled and normalized using the SequalPrep Normalization Plate Kit (Invitrogen). The 
normalized amplicon pool was concentrated down to ~100ul in a SpeedVac and then purified using 1x AmPure XP beads (Beckman 
Coulter). Libraries were quantified using the KAPA Library Quantification Kit (Illumina) and sequenced using 2x250 bp paired-end 
sequencing (Illumina MiSeq) with 15% PhiX spike-in. Demultiplexed reads were processed using QIIME2 with denoising by DADA2. 
Taxonomy was assigned using the DADA2 implementation of the RDP classifier using the DADA2 formatted training sets for SILVA128 
(benjjneb.github.io/dada2/assign.html). A phylogenetic tree was constructed via fragment insertion in QIIME2 (qiime fragment-insertion 
sepp). Sequence variants were filtered such that they were present in more than one sample with at least a total of 10 reads and a 
relative abundance of at least 0.0001 (0.01%) across the dataset. Samples with lower total read count than template control were 
discarded. Diversity metrics were generated using Vegan with principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) carried out with Ape. Differential 
abundance analysis of sequence variants was carried out using DESeq2 . Significant sequence variants (FDR<0.05) were visualized on a 
phylogenetic tree using ggtree. 

uantification of Bacterial Load 

DNA templates were diluted 100-fold before quantitative PCR (qPCR) of 16S rRNA gene copies was performed. qPCR was carried out in 
triplicate 10uL reactions with 200nM 340F/514R primers using a BioRad CFX384 thermocycler with SYBRSelect for CFX Master Mix (Life 
Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and an annealing temperature of 60˚C. Absolute quantifications were 
determined based against a standard curve of purified bacterial DNA. Mean values of triplicate reactions were taken for further 
downstream analyses. Absolute bacterial abundance was derived by adjustments for dilutions during DNA extraction, normalization, and 
PCR reaction preparation dividing by the total fecal mass used for DNA extraction in grams. 

etagenomic Sequencing and Analysis 

For a subset of samples that were subjected to 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, the same DNA extracts were subjected to shotgun 
metagenomic sequencing. Whole-genome shotgun libraries were prepared using the Nextera DNA Flex Library Preparation Kit (Illumina) 
with the Nextera DNA Unique Dual Indexes and sequenced on the NovaSeq S2 platform as 2 x 100 bp paired-end reads. Raw Illumina 
reads underwent quality trimming and adaptor removal using Fastp and host read removal by mapping to the human genome (GRCh38) 
with Bowtie2. Metagenomic samples were taxonomically profiled using MetaPhlan266 and functionally profiled using HUMAnN2 v0.11.1 
both with default parameters. Species from taxonomic profiles were retained for further analysis if their mean relative abundance 
exceeded 0.0001 (0.01%) across the dataset with non-zero abundances in at least 2 samples. Tables of pathway and gene family 
abundance obtained using HUMAnN2 were normalized to relative abundance using ‘humann2_renorm_table -units cpm’ including 
unmapped and unintegrated read mass. Pathway abundance files were joined into one abundance table and filtered to contain the 
pathways with top 75% mean abundance (final n = 290 pathways). Gene family files were regrouped using the humann2_regroup_table 
command with the ‘uniref90_ko’ term to KEGG Orthology (KO) groups of functional orthologs, thereby reducing the number of low-
abundance variables and numbers of tests to be performed downstream. Regrouped, per-sample KO abundance profiles were joined into 
one abundance table and filtered to contain features with top 75% mean abundance (final n = 3553 KOs). Differential abundance analysis 
of pathways and KO groups were carried out on normalized relative abundances and analyzed using Wilcoxon test with multiple testing 
correction via false discovery rate (FDR) estimation across features tested.

Outcomes

We designed a clinical study to test whether interventions designed to alter the gut microbiota cause significant differences in 
stool calorie loss, which serve as an experimentally quantifiable proxy for nutrient absorption.  
In this two-phase study, we directly measured stool and ingested calories along with plasma biomarkers of host and microbial 
metabolism during over- and under-feeding (Phase I) and then in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial with oral 
vancomycin versus placebo (Phase II).
