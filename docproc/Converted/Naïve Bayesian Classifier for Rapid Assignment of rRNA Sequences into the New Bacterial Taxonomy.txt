under each taxon.

Library comparison. For each of the greater than 1,000 bacterial taxa, the two
samples are compared to estimate the probability that the observed membership
could be drawn by chance from a single underlying distribution.

For taxa with greater than ﬁve sequences assigned, the standard two-popula-
tion proportions test is used to estimate the probability of the observed differ-
ences (7). The P value is estimated from the Z critical value, where

and where N1 and N2 are the total number of sequences for library 1 and 2,
respectively, x and y are the number of sequences assigned to taxon T from
library 1 and 2, respectively, and (cid:6) equals (x (cid:1) y)/(N1

(cid:1) N2).

For taxa with fewer than ﬁve sequences assigned, a statistical test ﬁrst developed
for comparing transcript levels in “digital Northern” analysis (2) is used. The prob-
ability of the observed difference in assignment to taxon T is estimated as follows:

Since each taxon is tested (multiple tests), reported signiﬁcance values must be
interpreted with caution. The taxa (and hence the tests) are nested, and no
attempt is made to correct for multiple tests.

SeqMatch k-NN classiﬁer. The RDP SeqMatch tool is a k-nearest-neighbor
(k-NN) classiﬁer (8). It uses a word-matching strategy not requiring alignment to
determine the percentage of shared seven-character words between a query and
members of a database of sequences. This tool assigns queries to the lowest taxon
shared by the highest-scoring k database sequences. For the tests described here,
the Bergey corpus was used as the database, and a query was assigned to the
same genus as the closest-matching sequence from the Bergey corpus (effec-
tively, k (cid:2) 1). Setting k to 1 ensured that all queries were classiﬁed at all
taxonomic ranks for comparison with the RDP Classiﬁer.

Phylogenetic analysis. Aligned 16S rRNA sequences were selected at the RDP
website and analyzed using the RDP Tree Builder tool. This tool utilizes Weigh-
bor (5), which uses the weighted neighbor-joining algorithm of phylogenetic
reconstruction. Weighbor parameters were set to alphabet size 4 and effective
sequence length 1,000, and the Jukes-Cantor distance correction was employed.
Tree Builder incorporates branch-order conﬁdence estimation using 100 boot-
strap samples. The resultant tree was downloaded in PostScript format and
embellished with Adobe Illustrator.

Implementation and availability. The Classiﬁer engine and related software
were written in Java (API v1.4.1) and have been tested on the Solaris (2.8), Linux
(2.4.23), Macintosh (OS 10.4), and Microsoft Windows XP operating systems
using Java virtual machines from Sun and Apple. The online version of Classiﬁer
and Library Compare are built on Java technology, including Java Server Page
and Java Servlet Technology (Sun Microsystems).

An online version of the Classiﬁer is available at http://rdp.cme.msu.edu
/classiﬁer. A user can submit one sequence or a group of sequences for classiﬁ-
cation. The sequences can be saved in a ﬁle for ﬁle upload or inserted into the
text area on the start page. The online Classiﬁer requires a sequence of at least
200 bases in length. Up to 10,000 query sequences may be submitted in Fasta,
GenBank, and EMBL formats. Single sequences may also be submitted in raw-
text format. The Classiﬁer automatically checks both the forward and reverse
orientations of the sequence and returns only the results for the correct orien-
tation. Taxonomic assignments above a user-speciﬁed conﬁdence threshold are
presented in an interactive taxonomic hierarchy. Each line in the hierarchy
contains summary information, including the taxon rank and name and the
number of query sequences assigned to that taxon. Users can navigate through
the hierarchy by clicking on the various taxa. Clicking on the “show assignment
detail” link will display the detailed classiﬁcation results for all or a speciﬁed
subset of the user’s queries. Each result contains the name of a user’s sequence,
a list of assigned taxa, and the corresponding conﬁdence estimates. In the detail
view, a “(cid:9)” after the sequence name indicates that the minus strand of the
sequence was submitted by the user. Results can be downloaded in a text format
and imported into a spreadsheet program for further analysis.

The online version of Library Compare is available at http://rdp.cme.msu.edu
/comparison. A user can upload two ﬁles containing sequences from two librar-
ies. After the sequences are classiﬁed, the statistical comparison analysis is

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Type sequences with Bergey’s taxonomy. Small-subunit rRNA sequences con-
sisting of 5,014 bacterial species type strain sequences in 988 genera (Table 1),
along with associated taxonomic assignment information, were obtained from
Bergey’s Taxonomic Outline of the Prokaryotes (release 5.0 [2004]) (13). The
sequences averaged 1,460 bases in length and had a range of 1,200 to 1,833 bases.
These sequences formed the Bergey corpus. Each sequence was labeled with
a set of taxa from domain to genus. From the highest rank to the lowest, the
major formal taxonomic ranks are domain, phylum, class, order, family,
genus, and species. There are occasional intermediate ranks such as “sub-
class” and “suborder”.

Complete rRNA database sequences with NCBI’s taxonomy. All available
(23,095) near-full-length ((cid:1)1,200 bases) 16S rRNA sequences were obtained
from the January 2004 release of the RDP. Taxonomic information for these
sequences was obtained from the January 2004 release of GenBank. These
sequences are classiﬁed into 1,187 genera in the NCBI taxonomy (3, 26). Initial
placement into the NCBI taxonomy is based on information provided by the
sequence submitter, with modiﬁcations by the NCBI staff. The sequences aver-
aged 1,454 bases in length. These sequences formed the NCBI corpus.

Algorithm. The Classiﬁer uses a feature space consisting of all possible 8-base
subsequences (words). Word sizes between 6 and 9 bases were tested in prelim-
inary experiments. Sizes of 8 and 9 bases gave nearly identical results, while sizes
of 6 and 7 bases were less accurate, especially with shorter test sequences (not
shown). As there are fewer possible words of size 8 than size 9, size 8 was chosen
for all further work to reduce memory requirements. The position of a word in
a sequence is ignored. As with text-based Bayesian classiﬁers, only those words
occurring in the query contribute to the score (16). A similar word-based clas-
siﬁcation scheme has been used to search for horizontal gene transfer events in
whole-genome sequences (21).

Word-speciﬁc priors. Let W (cid:2) {w1, w2, . . ., wd} be the set of all possible
eight-character subsequences (words). From the corpus consisting of N se-
quences, let n(wi) be the number of sequences containing subsequence wi. The
expected-likelihood estimate (determined with the Jeffreys-Perks law of succes-
(cid:2) [n(wi) (cid:1)
sion) calculated for each word over the entire corpus with the formula Pi
0.5]/(N (cid:1) 1) was used as a word-speciﬁc prior estimate of the likelihood of
observing word wi in an rRNA sequence. The values 0.5 in the numerator and 1
in the denominator keep the probabilities in the range 0 (cid:3) Pi

(cid:3) 1.

Genus-speciﬁc conditional probabilities. For genus G with a training set
consisting of M sequences, let m(wi) be the number of these sequences contain-
ing word wi. The conditional probability that a member of G contains wi was
estimated with the equation P(wi¦G) (cid:2) [m(wi) (cid:1) Pi]/(M (cid:1) 1). Ignoring the
dependency between words in an individual sequence, the joint probability of
observing from genus G a (partial) sequence, S, containing a set of words, V (cid:2)
{v1, v2, . . ., vf} (V (cid:1) W), was estimated as P(S¦G) (cid:2) (cid:4) P(vi¦G).

Naı¨ve Bayesian assignment. By Bayes’ theorem, the probability that an un-
known query sequence, S, is a member of genus G is P(G¦S) (cid:2) P(S¦G) (cid:5)
P(G)/P(S), where P(G) is the prior probability of a sequence being a member of
G and P(S) the overall probability of observing sequence S (from any genus).
Assuming all genera are equally probable (equal priors), the constant terms P(G)
and P(S) can be ignored. We classify the sequence as a member of the genus
giving the highest probability score, but we ignore the actual numerical proba-
bility estimate.

Bootstrap conﬁdence estimation. For each query sequence, the collection of
all eight-character subsequences (words) in the query was ﬁrst calculated. Nor-
mally, when data consist of independent features, a bootstrap sample size equal
to the number of features in the original sample is chosen. In this case, the
number of completely independent features equals the number of nonoverlap-
ping words. So for each bootstrap trial, a subset of one-eighth of the words was
randomly chosen (with replacement) and the words in this subset were then used
to calculate the joint probability. The number of times a genus was selected out
of 100 bootstrap trials was used as an estimate of conﬁdence in the assignment

each assignment. Overall,
for near-full-length sequences,
97.5% of taxon assignments matched in 95 or more of the 100
bootstrap trials, and these assignments were correct 98% of the
time (Tables 2 and 3).

We also conducted a similar series of exhaustive leave-one-
out testing using the RDP SeqMatch tool. The overall accura-
cies for near-full-length test sequences were similar to those of
the results for the RDP Classiﬁer: 99.5%, 98.8%, 97.8%,
95.1%, and 91.9% for the ranks phylum, class, order, family,
and genus, respectively.

Using the RDP 9 alignment (8), we extracted segments cor-
responding to 100-base regions of the Escherichia coli refer-
ence sequence J01695 at 25-base intervals and used each re-
gion independently for exhaustive leave-one-out
testing,
removing the corresponding full-length sequence from training
for each test. In general, accuracy was greater for regions
mapping to the 16S hypervariable regions (Fig. 2A). The av-
erage bootstrap conﬁdence estimate was similarly higher in the
hypervariable regions (Fig. 2B).

For each of the 393 near-full-length sequences misclassiﬁed
at the genus level, we determined the distance to other mem-
bers of the Bergey corpus by calculating the pairwise identity
between sequences using the corresponding aligned sequences
from the RDP website. For 250 of the misclassiﬁed sequences,
1 or more sequences in different genera were closer than all
other sequences in the genus to which the sequence was as-
signed in the taxonomy (Table 4).

To understand the nature of three of these misclassiﬁca-
tions, we explored sequences from the Alicyclobacillaceae fam-
ily. We chose this family because it contains three sequences
misclassiﬁed by the RDP Classiﬁer, only one of which was also

RESULTS

We tested the Classiﬁer by exhaustive leave-one-out testing
on the entire Bergey corpus. For each test, we reserved a single
sequence from the corpus as the test sequence and retrained
the Classiﬁer on the remaining sequences. The process was
repeated for all sequences in the corpus. The corpus contained
453 genera represented by single sequences. For these se-
quences, the (obviously) incorrect genus assignment was not
considered in the summary statistics, but the results were in-
cluded for higher ranks containing other genera with valid
training sets (Fig. 1). In addition to testing the near-full-length
sequence, we repeated the leave-one-out testing of the RDP
Classiﬁer on small contiguous regions of 400, 200, 100, and 50
bases chosen at random from the test sequence. The overall
accuracy for near-full-length and 400-base segments was above
88.7% down to the genus level. For 200-base segments, the
accuracy was still above 92.1% down to the family level, while
83.2% were classiﬁed accurately at the genus level. The accu-
racy for the 50-base segments was only 94.1% at the phylum
level and decreased dramatically to 51.5% at the genus level.
Bootstrap analysis was used to estimate the conﬁdence of

misclassiﬁed by SeqMatch. Bergey’s taxonomic placement of
these three sequences appeared not to be congruent with the
derived phylogeny (Fig. 3).

We tested the performance of the Classiﬁer on a more
diverse corpus consisting of 23,095 16S rRNA sequences as
classiﬁed by the NCBI in its taxonomy database. We randomly
chose a test set of 20% (4,619) of these for leave-one-out
testing, as described above. The accuracy using the NCBI tax-
onomy database and various query lengths was very similar to
the previous results (Table 5).

DISCUSSION

The RDP Classiﬁer was developed to provide rapid taxo-
nomic placement based on rRNA sequence data. As technical
improvements have made it easier to obtain rRNA data, the
use of these data has spread beyond the dedicated molecular

phylogenist. For many such users, a complete and thorough
phylogenetic analysis may not be an option. Instead, these
users may simply want a rapid method that provides a taxo-
for their unknowns. In addition, high-
nomic placement
throughput environmental rRNA projects routinely produce
hundreds to hundreds of thousands of sequences per sample. It
is unrealistic to imagine that all of these sequences will be
examined in detail. For these high-throughput experiments,
the RDP Classiﬁer can provide rapid taxonomic placement and
summary data, including the number of input sequences be-
longing to each taxon.

For the near-full-length and 400-base partial rRNA se-
quences, the Classiﬁer was accurate down to the genus level,
while even with 200-base partial sequences, the Classiﬁer was
accurate down to the family level. The Classiﬁer did not per-
form well for partial sequences with a length of 50 bases, likely
due to insufﬁcient features provided by such short partial se-
quences.

For shorter sequences, classiﬁcation conﬁdence was greatly
improved by using the bootstrap to estimate classiﬁcation re-
liability (Table 2). In our tests, most classiﬁcation assignments
were made with high conﬁdence. For near-full-length se-
quences, most misclassiﬁcations were probably due to errors in
the underlying taxonomy (see below), but for shorter se-
quences, misclassiﬁcations may reﬂect the lack of data. The
bootstrap helps determine whether available data are sufﬁcient
for a robust classiﬁcation. The majority of available rRNA
sequences are short (under 1,200 bases in length), and short
partial sequences are commonly used for environmental survey
sequencing.

Naı¨ve Bayesian classiﬁers are one example of supervised
classiﬁcation methods. The k-NN method is another super-
vised classiﬁcation method that is arguably simpler and often
works well in practice (16). We compared the RDP naı¨ve
Bayesian Classiﬁer with the RDP SeqMatch k-NN classiﬁer.

crepancies between the underlying (16S rRNA) phylogeny and
Bergey’s taxonomy. Over 60% of misclassiﬁed sequences were
actually more similar to sequences in other genera than to
sequences in their own genera, strong evidence that these
genera may not be monophyletic. These misclassiﬁcations are
not evenly distributed among the taxa. Of the three most rep-
resented phyla (Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria),
the Actinobacteria had the fewest errors (3%, or 31 in 1,220
trials), while the misclassiﬁcation rate for the Firmicutes was
about ﬁve times as high (13%, or 165 in 1,295 trials). Within
the Firmicutes, more than two-thirds of the errors occurred in
the class Clostridia (108 of 449 trials), and within that class, the
genus Eubacterium stood out, with 30 misclassiﬁcations in 41
trials (see the supplemental material).

To identify an example of the sources of errors in the tax-
onomy, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of classiﬁcation
errors in the family Alicyclobacillaceae (Fig. 3). The RDP Clas-
siﬁer misclassiﬁed three sequences from the Alicyclobacil-
laceae: Sulfobacillus disulﬁdooxidans and Sulfobacillus thermo-
sulﬁdooxidans, which were both misclassiﬁed in the genus
Alicyclobacillus, and Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris, which was
misclassiﬁed in the genus Bacillus. SeqMatch misclassiﬁed only
A. acidoterrestris. Interestingly, these three “errors” made by
the RDP Classiﬁer appear to be in agreement with phyloge-
netic analysis. Literature searches conﬁrmed that, subsequent
to the publication of version 5.0 of Bergey’s taxonomic outline,
all three had been reevaluated in line with the classiﬁcation
given by the RDP Classiﬁer. The strains originally attributed to
Sulfobacillus were both reevaluated in 2005 and reassigned to
the genus Alicyclobacillus, matching the classiﬁcation of the
RDP Classiﬁer but no longer matching the classiﬁcation from
SeqMatch. The sequence originally attributed to A. acidoter-
restris was the result of a culture mix-up and belongs in the
genus Bacillus, as assigned by both classiﬁers. Unlike the Seq-
Match nearest-neighbor classiﬁer, the RDP naı¨ve Bayesian
Classiﬁer uses information averaged over the entire genus and
hence is less inﬂuenced by individual misplaced training se-
quences.

Pyrosequencing can now produce up to 100 Mb in less than
8 h (Roche product literature). Sogin and colleagues recently
used the ﬁrst version of pyrosequencing, which provided up-
to-100-bp reads, to rapidly analyze large numbers of 16S rRNA
V6 variable regions from environmental samples (23). In that
study, taxonomic diversity was assessed through alignment to
members of a reference database of vetted V6 sequences. The
classiﬁcation accuracy of the RDP Classiﬁer for 100-base frag-
ments varied greatly by region along the 16S rRNA molecule
(Fig. 2). Variable regions were, in general, more accurately

FIG. 3. Phylogenetic analysis of the Alicyclobacillaceae, including
the genera Sulfobacillus and Alicyclobacillus. Sequences for each of the
11 species type strains of Alicyclobacillaceae available in release 5.0 of
Bergey’s taxonomic outline, along with additional sequences for four
Alicyclobacillaceae species type strains that became available after the
release of the outline (marked with an asterisk), and two Bacillus
species type strains were analyzed using the weighted neighbor-joining
method (5). The tree is rooted using Escherichia coli sequence J01695
as the outgroup. Bootstrap conﬁdence estimates above 85% are
shown. Three misclassiﬁcations made by the RDP Classiﬁer are high-
lighted, with the original (release 5.0) description appended with a
corrected description. S. disulﬁdooxidansT became A. disulﬁdooxi-
dansT. In 2005, S. disulﬁdooxidans was formally reclassiﬁed as a new
combination, A. disulﬁdooxidans (14). S. thermosulﬁdooxidans VKM
1269T became “A. tolerans K1.” In release 5, sequence Z21979 was
listed as coming from the type strain (VKM 1269) of S. thermosulﬁ-
dooxidans. This agrees with the original publication for the sequence
(25). The same group later reported that the sequence was probably
from S. thermosulﬁdooxidans strain K1, not VKM 1269 (15). Two
independent sequences (X91080 and AB089844) for the type strain of
S. thermosulﬁdooxidans are available. They are nearly identical to each
other (0.2% difference) and 19% different from Z21979. In 2005, S.
thermosulﬁdooxidans strain K1 was reclassiﬁed as the type strain of a
new species, A. tolerans (14). In our analysis, however, the sequence for
K1 given in the naming paper (accession number AF137502) is 8%
different from that for Z21979. Although still listed in the GenBank
record as from A. tolerans strain K1, Z21979 is most probably not from
strain K1 and not even from a member of the species A. tolerans. A.
acidoterrestrisT became Bacillus sp. Sequence X60602 was published
in 1991 as from the type strain (DSM 3922) for A. acidoterrestris (1).
The GenBank record also lists this as from strain DSM 3922, but a
strain mix-up in the culture supplied by the DSMZ was reported in
1992 (27). The type strain (ATCC 49025, listed by the DSMZ as
equivalent to DSM 3922) was resequenced in 2005 (AY573797 [9]).
These two sequences are 14% different, and X60602 is now de-
scribed by GenBank as from a Bacillus sp.

We chose to use SeqMatch for the comparison, because it, like
the RDP Classiﬁer, is offered through the RDP. Also, Seq-
Match has been shown to be more accurate than BLAST in
ﬁnding the most similar rRNA sequence as deﬁned by pairwise
aligned distance (8). The RDP Classiﬁer and RDP SeqMatch
had nearly identical overall error rates. However, only about
two-thirds of these errors were in common (not shown). For
both classiﬁers, many of these misclassiﬁcations appeared to
result from errors in the underlying taxonomy (not shown);
however, the two classiﬁers often responded differently to spe-
ciﬁc taxonomic anomalies.

Many, if not most, of the 393 misclassiﬁcations made by the
RDP Classiﬁer with the Bergey corpus are likely due to dis-

levels of conﬁdence), while accuracy for fragments containing
the V6 region were less reliably classiﬁed (73% at the genus
level). The V6 region is rather small (46 bases) and ﬂanked by
highly conserved regions (6). In contrast, the V2 region is
ﬂanked on both sides and the V4 region is ﬂanked on the 3(cid:10)
side by semiconserved regions. These regions likely account for
both the increased accuracy for and the broadened peaks
around these variable regions. These regions may make good
targets as the read length of pyrosequencing technology in-
creases.

In bacteriology, although nomenclature is governed by an
ofﬁcial code, there is no deﬁnitive or ofﬁcial taxonomy. The
RDP Classiﬁer is not limited to using the bacterial taxonomy
proposed in Bergey’s Taxonomic Outline of the Prokaryotes
(13). We chose Bergey’s taxonomy for use because it is readily
available and Bergey’s Manual of Systematic Bacteriology is
widely respected in the microbiological community. The RDP
Classiﬁer worked equally well when trained on the NCBI tax-
onomy. There is signiﬁcant congruence between the two tax-
onomies, and both are based, at least in part, on phylogenetic
principals. The RDP Classiﬁer likely can be adapted to addi-
tional phylogenetically coherent bacterial taxonomies that may
gain acceptance in the future.

For query sequences from regions of bacterial diversity with
less-deﬁned taxonomy, the RDP Classiﬁer tends to provide
classiﬁcation results with low conﬁdence estimates. For exam-
ple, in one library of Acidobacteria environmental clone se-
quences, 72 of 77 sequences were classiﬁed with less than 80%
conﬁdence even at the phylum level (not shown). Such low
conﬁdence classiﬁcation results may help identify sequences
for which a more thorough analysis is likely to give the highest
payoff.

The RDP Classiﬁer is fast enough to handle large sample
volumes. For example, on a 2.66-GHz Apple Intel Xeon pro-
cessor, the program classiﬁes approximately nine sequences
per second (with 100 bootstrap samples of each). The online
version of the Classiﬁer returns results for submissions of up to
10,000 user sequences in a few minutes and provides both
summary and detailed classiﬁcation assignments. The Library
Compare tool enables the analysis of microbial community
composition based on the taxonomic group assignments. This
tool leverages the Classiﬁer to provide rapid comparison of
two samples, each containing up to 5,000 sequences. The re-
sults can be explored interactively and can also be downloaded
in a form suitable for importing into common spreadsheet
programs.

The RDP has been using the RDP Classiﬁer with Bergey’s
taxonomy internally for over 4 years to give order to its col-
lection of over 300,000 bacterial rRNA sequences. During that
time, the RDP has updated the Classiﬁer to use data from
three successive versions of Bergey’s taxonomic outline. This
taxonomy is still evolving as species are reevaluated and dis-
crepancies are resolved. As these updates have been released,
it has proved relatively simple to retrain the Classiﬁer and
update the assignments for sequences in the RDP library. As
bacterial taxonomy continues to evolve, we expect the Classi-
ﬁer’s performance to continue to improve.
