Figure 1. Environmental factors shape and change the microbiome over time and perturbations can lead to disease. Maternal
factors: vaginal infections and gut microbiome can lead to bacterial translocation into the uterus. Postnatal factors: mode of
delivery, breastfeeding versus formula feeding, introduction of solid food, and early life adversity and antibiotic exposure can
shape the developing microbiome in early childhood. Environmental factors across the lifespan: long-term diet and exposure
to animals can modify the microbiome throughout childhood and adulthood. Perturbations to the microbiome: medications,
such as antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, and metformin, and a variety of different diets can make individuals more prone to
disease, such as inﬂammatory bowel disease, IBS, and obesity. Stress can lead to changes in the microbiome that affects
intestinal permeability and SCFA production. Smoking can cause microbial shifts that change inﬂammatory signaling and
colonic mucin production, all of which can be mechanisms that lead to the development of disease.

Actinomycetales, and Alphaproteobacteria are associated
with preterm delivery, it has been shown that a variety of
other microbes may be present in the placenta, umbilical
cord, amniotic ﬂuid, and meconium of normal preg-
nancy.7–9 The maternal microbiome is likely translocated
into the uterus via the bloodstream, an idea supported by
the detection of labeled Enterococcus faecium in the
meconium of inoculated pregnant mice.7 In a recent
population-based study, researchers found the most

However, the role and function of these microbes in
human health or disease during the prenatal period re-

contamination, it is difﬁcult to deﬁnitively establish the
presence of a prenatal microbiome.12 Further studies are

Delivery. Although the existence of a prenatal micro-
biome may be controversial, many agree that the ﬁrst
major introduction of a microbial community to a
newborn is through delivery.6
As the newborn is passing
through the vaginal canal, it is ultimately introduced to
the commensal vaginal and fecal microbiome of the
mother.13 This community of microbes seems to be
distinct from the community of nonpregnant women
because the vaginal microbiome changes during preg-
nancy.14 For example, healthy pregnant women, when
compared with nonpregnant women, had lower vaginal
bacterial diversity with higher levels of Lactobacillus,
Clostridiales, Bacteroidales, and Actinomycetales; these
levels were associated with gestational age.15 Beyond
the vaginal microbiome, there is also evidence that the
community of the maternal gut also changes during the

course of pregnancy. For example, a Finnish cohort of
91 healthy pregnant women demonstrated decreased
bacterial diversity as evidenced by increased levels of
high-energy-yielding fecal microbiota with increasing
gestational age.16 From the ﬁrst to the third trimester,
the proportion of Proteobacteria, including species of the
Enterobacteriaceae family and Streptococcus genus,
decreased, whereas the proportion of Faecalibacterium
prausnitzii increased. These changes in the microbiome
were independent of prepregnancy body weight, gesta-
tional diabetes, diet, and antibiotic use, suggesting that
they were caused by the changes of normal pregnancy.
These changes in the microbiome have a beneﬁcial role
for the mother and neonate by protecting against certain
infections, such as Neisseria gonorrhea and bacterial
vaginosis, and also by permitting greater efﬁciency for
energy harvest to support the growth of the mother and
fetus.16,17

With these

speciﬁc pregnancy-related changes
effecting the vaginal and fecal microbiome of the mother,
it is unsurprising that the mode of delivery also greatly
affects how the newborn microbiome develops. The dif-
ferences seen between cesarean section (C-section) and
vaginally delivered babies are drastic. Compared with
vaginally born babies, those that are born by C-section
without membrane rupture have no vaginal microbes,
such as Lactobacillus, Prevotella, and Sneathia. Instead,
babies born by C-section are colonized with skin mi-
crobes, such as Staphylococcus, Propionibacterium, and
Corynebacterium.18 These babies have a delayed coloni-
zation of intestinal microbes, such as Bacteroides and
Biﬁdobacterium.19 Although the exact length of time
these differences exist is unknown, microbial differences
between C-section and vaginally delivered babies have
been observed to as far out as 7 years of age.20 The
deﬁcits in the human microbiome associated with
C-section deliveries have been implicated in certain
childhood autoimmune disease, such as celiac disease,
asthma, and type I diabetes.21 These studies also suggest
that restoration of a more “normal” microbiome after
C-section deliveries may therefore be beneﬁcial. “Vaginal
seeding,” or the process by which vaginal ﬂuids are
applied to a newborn child delivered by C-section, has
been a method used to restore the human microbiome.
Although a small pilot study of 4 babies demonstrated
the feasibility of restoring the early microbiome of babies
born by C-section,22 the long-term health consequence of
such a procedure remains unknown and may even in-
crease the risk of transmittable diseases to the newborn.
Therefore, further prospective studies are needed to
determine the safety and potential beneﬁts, if any, of
these methods used to restore the human microbiome.

Even though the mode of delivery is important to
microbial seeding, it may not be the only mode for ver-
tical transmission. Recent human studies have high-
lighted maternal vertical transmission from multiple
different sources, such as the skin, mouth, and gastro-
intestinal track.23,24 By examining strain-level data, these

studies demonstrated that the direct mother-to-infant
transmission changes over time as different ﬂoras are
introduced through processes, such as skin contact and
breastfeeding.23,24

Breastfeeding and introduction of solid food. The
other major early life events that affect the development
and maturation of the newborn microbiome are breast-
feeding and the introduction of solid food. Breast milk
bacteria, such as Corynebacterium and Rothia, can seed
the infant gut and inﬂuence the bacteria that follows,
affecting the communities even through adulthood.25
These early seeding events may be the mechanism by
which breast milk can protect children against autoim-
mune diseases, such as asthma and type 1 diabetes.26

Similar to the vaginal microbiome, it has been shown
that the microbiome of breast milk also varies with
increasing gestational age, and is related to maternal
health and mode of delivery.26,27 The breast milk mi-
crobial community is dominated by Corynebacterium,
Ralstonia, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Serratia, Pseu-
domonas, Propionibacterium, Sphingomonas, and Bra-
dyrhizobiaceae.26 In a study of 107 healthy women who
were breastfeeding their infants for the ﬁrst 30 days of
life, the gut microbiome changed in a dose-dependent
manner with 27.7% of the mean bacteria being derived
from breast milk and 10.3% from areola skin.26

Breast milk also contains many important prebiotic
compounds, such as human milk oligosaccharides. These
sugar polymers are almost exclusively metabolized by
the gut microbiome28 and they can promote the growth
of key communities including Biﬁdobacterium spp.29
Biﬁdobacteria has been shown to inhibit the growth of
pathogenic organisms and improve barrier function in
the infant gut.30 In a mouse model, human milk oligo-
saccharides were found to be protective in the develop-
ment of autoimmune disease and obesity.31,32

There are clear differences in the composition of the
microbiome in infants who are breastfed versus those
who are formula fed. Infants who are breastfed have a
higher proportion of Biﬁdobacterium and Lactobacillus
spp, whereas infants who are formula-fed have a higher
proportion of Clostridiales and Proteobacteria.33,34
Formula-fed infants also have lower diversity and rich-
ness even after the ﬁrst year of life as compared with
their breastfed counterparts.33 In a study of 30 preterm
infants, breastfeeding was found to be protective against
gut immaturity and possibly necrotizing enterocolitis.35
Several other epidemiologic studies have provided sup-
port for the beneﬁcial role of breastfeeding in the
development of disease. Formula feeding has been
associated with various inﬂammatory and autoimmune
diseases.36 In contrast, breastfeeding, through its effects
on the microbiome, has been associated with a protective
role against asthma, autism spectrum disorder, and type
1 diabetes.26,36

One of the last major events in early life affecting mi-
crobial development is the introduction of solid food.
Although breast milk keeps the microbiome in a state that

is characterized by low diversity and Biﬁdobacterium
predominance, the introduction of solid food and the
cessation of breastfeeding increases adult-associated mi-
crobes, such as Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae.37
In a Danish study of 330 children between 9 and 36
age, Lactobacillaceae, Biﬁdobacteriaceae,
months of
Enterococcaceae,
and Enterobacteriaceae decreased,
whereas Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Bacter-
oidaceae increased during the period when solid foods
was being introduced.38 Another study of 531 children
born in 5 different countries showed similar results in-
dependent of location, use of antibiotics, mode of delivery,
or milk feeding practices, suggesting that these changes
were typical of the normal developing microbiome as
solid foods are being introduced.39 This transition is
necessary and beneﬁcial. It allows for a microbial com-
munity that is better equipped to extract energy and
process a diet that is no longer dependent on milk to a
diet that is higher in ﬁber and protein, similar to the diet
of a mature adult.

Early life adversity. Recently, researchers are discov-
ering that early life adverse events can manipulate the
microbial community in signiﬁcant ways. In rats, limited
nesting stress during postnatal days 2–10 led to a
delayed maturation of
the hypothalamic-pituitary-
adrenal axis that was associated with decreased micro-
bial diversity, an increase of gram-positive cocci, and a
reduction of ﬁber-degrading bacteria.40 Similar ﬁndings
were demonstrated in mice and rhesus monkeys when
exposed to stress at an early age.41,42 Finally, in patients
with IBS, those that had a microbiome proﬁle distinct
from healthy control subjects were more likely to have a
history of early adverse events and trauma than those
with a microbiome that was more similar to healthy
control subjects.43 Although these studies are predomi-
nantly associations, exploring how adverse events and
early gut dysbiosis can cause such diseases as IBS is an
active research area.

Antibiotic use can also play a signiﬁcant role during
early life. The average U.S. child receives about 1–3
antibiotic courses by the age of 2 years.44 Several studies
have highlighted how antibiotic exposure in children can
be associated with an increased risk for obesity, diabetes,
IBS, and inﬂammatory bowel dis-
allergies, asthma,
ease.33,45 Children exposed to antibiotics have delayed
maturation of their microbiome as compared with their
respective control subjects, but whether this is the exact
mechanism by which early antibiotics predisposes chil-
dren to disease is still unclear.33 In animal models, per-
ipartum antibiotic exposure in the mother can lead to
persistent gut dysbiosis in the offspring and colitis in
susceptible individuals.46,47 Although these studies do
not provide an exact mechanistic explanation of the ef-
fect of antibiotic use on microbiome development or on
disease susceptibility, they do highlight that early anti-
biotic exposure is linked in some way to the normal
development of microbial community and to disease
development.

Diet

During the early stages of life, breast milk and the
introduction of solid food are critical events in the
development of the human microbiome. Therefore, it is
not surprising that the introduction of diet throughout
life has large effects on the human microbiome. The gut
microbiota can change within days of a new diet, but to
what extent these changes are permanent once the new
diet has terminated remains uncertain.48 In this section,
we review the current literature, focusing on popular
diets and how the microbiome is connected (summarized
in Table 2).

Western diet. The Western diet or standard American
diet is a diet characterized by high fat, high sugar, high
level of red and processed meat, high levels of reﬁned
grains, and a lower level of ﬁber.48 Many studies have
linked the Western diet to inﬂammation, diabetes, car-
diovascular risks, obesity, and metabolic syndrome.48,49
Although a Western diet affects many different cell
types, such as adipocytes, immune cells, and endocrine
cells, there is also a strong link that connects the dele-
terious effects of a Western diet to shifts in the micro-
biome.48 Compared with other indigenous diets, the
microbiome on a Western diet is characterized by a
signiﬁcantly lower microbial diversity and species rich-
ness.50 The Western diet microbial composition is clas-
sically characterized by an overabundance of the phyla
Firmicutes and a decrease in Bacteroidetes.51 On a genus
level, a Western diet shows a decrease in Biﬁdobacterium
and Lactobacillus, whereas being high in Enterobacter.52
Consequently, the Western diet has been linked to an
increase in endotoxemia, a state characterized by
decreased intestinal barrier function and increased levels
and inﬂammatory
of bacterial
signaling.53,54 Furthermore, a Western diet can possibly
lead to permanent microbiome changes that may be
responsible for postdieting weight regain or the common
concept of yo-yo dieting, which has been linked to higher
long-term weight gain,
increased obesity-related risk
factors, and increased difﬁculty reducing weight.55

lipopolysaccharides

Mediterranean diet. In contrast to a Western diet, a
Mediterranean diet is considered a healthier diet. It is
characterized by a beneﬁcial fatty acid proﬁle; higher
intake of ﬁber, vegetables, and fruits; and with lower
intake of sugar and red meat.56 A recent study demon-
strated that out of 153 participants, those who were
more adherent to a Mediterranean diet had an increased
level of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), Prevotella, and
certain Firmicutes, which have all been associated with
decreased cardiovascular events.57 Additionally,
they
also showed that low adherence to the Mediterranean
diet led to decreases in urinary trimethylamine oxide
levels, which is associated with higher cardiovascular
risk.57,58 Several studies have shown that consumption of
foods encompassing the typical Mediterranean diet
improved obesity, inﬂammation, and lipid proﬁle and
in Lactobacillus,

Protein. Although such diets as the Western diet and
the Mediterranean diet have varying compositions of
protein, fat, and ﬁber, studies have found that the gut
microbiome can also be affected by these individual
components. High protein consumption can have a large
effect on human health and the microbiome. Overall,
studies have shown that a diet that is high in protein
correlates positively with microbial diversity, which is
important in intestinal health and barrier function.60,61
However, not all protein is the same because the
source of the protein, whether from animals or plants,
can have very different effects on the microbiome.

Diets high in plant-based protein can increase Biﬁ-
dobacterium and Lactobacillus, while decreasing patho-
genic species, such as Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium
perfringens.62 These shifts are associated with higher
levels of SCFA and possibly improved gut barrier

function.62 However, diets high in animal protein have
consistently been associated with an increase in Bacter-
oides, Alistipes, Bilophila, and intestinal inﬂammation.63,64
Although, diets high in animal protein can have imme-
diate effects associated with weight loss, these shifts can
be detrimental to colonic health in the long term.65 An-
imal protein is associated with an increased level of
microbial-derived toxic metabolites, such as amines and
sulﬁdes, within the colon.66 The proinﬂammatory state
induced by animal protein is one of the potential mech-
anisms that explained the 3.3-fold increased risk of in-
ﬂammatory bowel disease in a prospective cohort of
67,581 participants.63 This observation was corrobo-
rated in a recent animal study demonstrating how di-
etary protein can change the density of
the fecal
microbiota while increasing intestinal permeability and
the severity of dextran sulfate sodium–induced colitis.67
Fats. Similar to the changes seen in the microbiome
with proteins, fats are also not all equal. A Western diet

that is high in saturated fat and trans fat has been linked
to obesity and cardiovascular disease, whereas a diet rich
in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats can be
protective.68 To study this, Fava et al69 examined 88
subjects at risk for metabolic syndrome and fed them
varying amounts and types of fats. They found that diets
high in saturated fats led to an increase of F prausnitzii
and reduced bacterial richness, whereas a diet high in
monounsaturated fats did not have any signiﬁcant shifts
in any bacterial genera. In another larger, cross-sectional
study with 876 women, Menni et al70 demonstrated that
polyunsaturated fats were associated with an increase in
microbial diversity and an increase in members of the
Lachnospiraceae family.

Mouse studies have also offered insights regarding
differences in microbial composition related to type and
amount of fat intake. For example, a recent study found
that mice fed lard fat had a higher abundance of Bac-
teroides and Bilophila, whereas mice fed ﬁsh oil–derived
fat had higher levels of Akkermansia and Lactobaccillus.71
The mice on a lard fat diet also had higher toll-like re-
ceptor activation and white adipose tissue inﬂammation,
in addition to a decrease in insulin sensitivity relative to
mice fed on the ﬁsh oil–derived fat. Transplantation of
the microbiome of the lard fat–fed mice into germ-free
mice successfully replicated the donor’s inﬂammatory
and metabolic phenotypes, suggesting that these path-
ways were at least in part mediated by the gut micro-
biome.71 Another potential mechanism by which fat
intake can affect the host’s microbiome is through al-
terations of the host circadian rhythm.72 Several recent
studies have shown that the microbiome has a diurnal
variation in structure and function and that these vari-
ations can modify the host circadian clock genes.73,74 A
diet high in saturated fats disturbs normal diurnal
microbial patterns leading to host dysregulation of
circadian rhythm and metabolism, potentially promoting
diet-induced obesity.72

Dietary ﬁber. Unlike protein and fat, the gut micro-
biome is absolutely necessary for the metabolism of di-
etary ﬁber. Carbohydrates,
in particular those with
dietary ﬁber, are a principal source of energy for colonic
microbes. The recommended daily intake of ﬁber per day
is 25–30 g. The average American only ingests about 15 g
per day, highlighting the substantial deﬁcit in ﬁber intake
needed for the healthy function of the colon.75 Evolu-
tionarily, the human diet was very heavy in dietary ﬁber
as compared with ﬁber content in the current more
modern diets. The diet and microbiome of indigenous
populations in Papua New Guinea, Tanzania, and the
Amazon rainforest are markedly different from those in
the industrialized societies.76 With the advent of farming
and industrialization, modern diets have become heavier
in protein and fat while lighter in dietary ﬁber. This di-
etary shift has led to a reduction in microbial diversity
that has been linked to a higher susceptibility of more
Western diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, and inﬂam-
matory bowel disease.76 Several studies have shown

ﬁber to be protective against such diseases as type II
diabetes, cardiovascular disease, colon cancer, and
obesity.77,78 One of the main mechanism by which ﬁber
and the microbiome impact health is through the pro-
duction of SCFAs. SCFAs are the major product of ﬁber
fermentation and represent a major substrate for energy
for colonic cells. Acetate, propionate, and butyrate are
the major SCFAs, accounting for 90% of the total, with
ratios approximating 65:20:15.79 SCFA can affect gene
regulation and colonocyte proliferation and inﬂamma-
tion.80 In diversion colitis, a disease state characterized
by distal inﬂammation, the role of butyrate enemas as a
treatment highlights the importance of SCFA to colonic
health. The capacity of SCFA to regulate colonocyte
differentiation and apoptosis further underscores its
potential to protect against colon cancer.80 In mouse
models of obesity, ﬁber supplementation prevented
inﬂammation and metabolic syndrome by restoring
interleukin-22 production within the colon.81 Diets high
in ﬁber tend to have higher microbial richness and di-
versity with an abundance in such genera as Prevotella
and Treponema.82 These shifts have been linked to a
decrease in inﬂammatory signaling, protection against
obesity, and possibly decrease in the presence of colo-
rectal cancer.82

Other Environmental Factors

Even though early life events and diet can shape the
way the microbiome is formed, there are many other
environmental exposures throughout the lifespan into
adulthood that can lead to changes in microbial compo-
sition and ultimately health (Figure 1).

Pharmaceuticals

One of the most signiﬁcant ways to affect health and
the microbiome is through the use of drugs. Antibiotics
are the most well-known class of medications to cause
shifts in the microbiome. Although the microbial com-
munity mostly returns to its preantibiotic state, studies
have suggested that postantibiotic exposure can lead to a
new steady state that is different from the original pre-
antibiotic community.83 This new steady state that
emerges after antibiotic exposure increases the host’s
susceptibility to infection, atopic diseases, and metabolic
syndrome.84 Long-term studies have shown that these
effects of antibiotics can be long lasting, as far out as 4
years postexposure.85 Antibiotics may also expand
antibiotic-resistant strains, which can act as a reservoir
for resistance genes in the gut microbiome.86

The effect of antibiotics on the microbiome is best
highlighted by the research regarding Clostridium difﬁ-
cile. Changes in the gut microenvironment after the
exposure of antibiotics creates a metabolic environment
that favors C difﬁcile germination and colonization.87 C
difﬁcile can be a debilitating disease for patients and

costly to the medical system. Although the mainstay of C
difﬁcile treatment is further antibiotic therapy,
fecal
microbiota transplantation has gained substantial credi-
bility for the treatment of recurrent C difﬁcile.88 The ﬁrst
randomized trial of
fecal microbiota transplantation
demonstrated higher rates of resolution of C difﬁcile
infection when compared with placebo (81% vs 31%).89
Since then, several other studies have shown the efﬁcacy
and safety of fecal microbiota transplantation for pa-
tients with C difﬁcile.88

Medications other than antibiotics have also been
associated with changes in the human microbiome.
Proton pump inhibitors and metformin are 2 notable
common examples, with more than 100 million users of
either medication in the United States alone.90,91
Through reduced acid production and hence higher
luminal pH, proton pump inhibitors have been shown to
alter the ﬂora of the stomach in chronic users and in-
crease the incidence of small bacterial overgrowth.92 In a
study examining individuals with type 2 diabetes, Wu
et al93 demonstrated that the introduction of metformin
strongly alters
the gut microbiome. They further
demonstrated that the beneﬁcial effects of metformin can
be transferred to germ-free mice through fecal trans-
plantation, providing support that the alteration of the
gut microbiome mediates some of metformin’s antidia-
betic effects.93 The idea of nonantibiotic drugs effecting
the microbiome led Maier et al94 to screen more than
1000 marketed drugs highlighting that 24% of them
could affect bacterial growth. Although these studies
demonstrate dramatic effects on the gut microbiome,
further research is needed to see how these drugs can
affect microbial communities and how these changes are
related to drug efﬁcacy.

Family Life

Pets. Other than pharmaceuticals, household pets and
animal exposure can also inﬂuence the microbiome. In a
study of 60 families with or without pets, household
members’ skin ﬂora was more similar to each other and
to their pets than to other households without pets.95
This highlights the theory that pets play a critical part
as a conduit to the environment and their human coin-
habitants. Many studies have reported that the exposure
during early life to pets or to farm animals is associated
with less pediatric allergy.96,97 The theory is related to
the idea that pets and farm animals introduce environ-
mental allergens that sensitize the developing immune
system of the child.98 The fact that these exposures are
mediated through microbes is supported by studies that
demonstrate how certain bacterial species, such as Aci-
netobacter lwoﬁi and Lactococcus lactis, which are iso-
lated from farming communities, can reduce allergic
responses in mouse models.99 In a study of 24 healthy,
full-term infants, microbial richness and diversity of fecal
samples were higher in infants living with pets.100

Infants living with pets showed a reduction of Biﬁdo-
bacteriaceae and an increase in Peptostreptococcaceae.
Another study found that Biﬁdobacterium longum levels
were higher in fecal samples of infants with pet exposure
compared with those without and that the abundance of
B longum was inversely associated with the onset of
wheezy bronchitis. However, the role of animal exposure
on the adult gut microbiome still remains unclear.

Smoking. Another important environmental exposure
is smoking. Although the link between smoking and
disease has been well established, several studies have
emerged over the last several years that explore the in-
ﬂuence of smoking on the oral, esophageal, and gastric
microbiome.101 Within the mouth, smokers tend to have
an increase in anaerobic bacteria leading to shifts in a
community that possibly favors pathogenic microbes.101
In regards to the intestinal microbiome, mouse models
and human studies have indicated that smoking can
affect microbial composition and intestinal inﬂammation.
A recent study that used side-stream smoke on wild-type
C57BL/6 mice demonstrated that smoke can increase the
abundance of Clostridium clostridiforme and decrease
Lactococcus, Ruminococcus albus, and the family of
Enterobacteriacae.102 These shifts were associated with
a change in tight junction proteins and inﬂammatory
signaling.

In humans, smoking has been associated with a
decrease in Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, in addition to
an increase in Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria.103 An
observational study demonstrated that after smoking
cessation, the levels of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria
reversed and microbial diversity increases.103,104 Similar
ﬁndings were found in patients with active Crohn’s dis-
ease. In a study of 103 smoking and nonsmoking patients
with active Crohn’s disease compared with 66 smoking
and nonsmoking healthy control subjects, active smoking
was independently associated with higher abundance of
Bacteroides and Prevotella, genera commonly associated
with colonic inﬂammation.105,106 The exact mechanism
on how smoking affects the microbiome is an active area
of research; however, it may be linked to alterations of
intestinal tight junction, immune signaling, and/or mucin
production.102,107 Whether these changes in the intesti-
nal microbiome mediate some of the deleterious effects
of smoking remains unclear.

Stress. In recent years there is growing evidence that
there are bidirectional communication pathways be-
tween the gut microbiome and the brain, and recent
studies have highlighted that this communication takes
place through various processes including the vagus
nerve, gut hormone signaling, inﬂammatory processes,
to name a
and neurotransmitter production,
few.108,109 Therefore, real or perceived stress can
modulate this bidirectional communication in a way
that increases dysbiosis and increases an individual’s
propensity to develop disease.110,111 For example, stress
can trigger the ﬂight or ﬁght response, increasing the
corticotropin-releasing hormone and
production of

catecholamine production from the central nervous
system, which then modulates gut microbiome func-
tion.111,112 However, bottom up processes involving
release of microbial products, such as tryptophan or
serotonin, during stressful events can contribute to the
enteric dysbiosis, increased intestinal permeability, and
the release of certain neurotransmitters associated with
certain diseases.113 Studies have also shown that in the
absence of stress and during stress-reducing practices,
such as meditation, the microbiota increase production
of SCFAs and anti-inﬂammatory processes,

Clinical Implications of Altered
Human Microbiome

Although previous sections have shown how envi-
ronmental exposures, such as diet, stress, pets, and
medications, can affect the microbiome, perturbations in
the microbiome can also be a potential cause for disease
(Figure 1). Although there are many diseases that are
associated with microbial dysbiosis, we review the dis-
eases with the best causal relationship between the
environment and the microbiome: obesity and IBS.

Obesity

The previous section underscored the notable shifts
in the microbiome that occur with a Western diet and a
high-fat diet. These diets are tightly linked to obesity and
many believe that the microbiome is a key mediator. One
of the early seminal papers that linked obesity and diet
to the gut microbiome came from Turnbaugh et al in
2006.115 They used human and mice16s rRNA analyses
to highlight how obesity and a high-fat diet were related
to an increased ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes and
that colonization of this obesity-related microbial proﬁle
could recapitulate the obese phenotype in germ-free
mice. Since then, animal studies have shown that gut
microbes can inﬂuence weight gain and adiposity by
affecting host gene expression, metabolic pathways, and
the
in-
terventions have also been associated with distinct shifts
in the gut microbiome. A variety of surgical weight loss
intervention in humans and in animals have shown
distinct and long-lasting microbial proﬁle differences.117
A study using Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in mice led to a
sustained increase in Escherichia and Akkermansia and
that the transfer of fecal material of post–bariatric sur-
gery mice into nonoperated germ-free mice can suc-
cessfully transfer the lean phenotype.118 Mechanisms by
which microbes can cause host metabolic changes
include shifts in SCFA production; changes in energy

gut-brain axis.116 Moreover, weight

loss

extraction; decreased gut hormones, such as glucagon-
like peptide and peptide YY; and changes in toll-like re-
ceptor signaling.119

Irritable Bowel Syndrome

Much like obesity, IBS is one of the most common
diseases seen by primary care doctors and gastroenter-
ologists. Factors linked to the pathogenesis of IBS include
a history of enteric infection, alteration in the gut-brain
axis, changes in visceral sensitivity, and modiﬁcations
in the gut microbiome.43,120 Studies have linked early life
stress and adverse events to microbial shifts that could
potentially be the cause of visceral sensitivity and sub-
IBS development.43,108,121 Patients with IBS
sequent
generally had less Lactobacillus, Biﬁdobacterium, and F
prausnitzii than healthy control subjects.113 Although it
is unclear which changes are necessary and/or sufﬁcient,
studies in germ-free mice transplanted with fecal mi-
crobes from patients with IBS cause alterations in gut
permeability, motility, visceral perception, and food
processing that ultimately triggers IBS symptoms.122 The
treatment of IBS is varied and often personalized, but
certain therapeutics for IBS with diarrhea often target
the gut microbiota. These include the use of nonsystemic
antibiotic rifaximin; dietary modiﬁcation with a low
oligosaccharides, disaccharides, mono-
fermentable
saccharides, and polyols diet; and certain probiotic for-
mulations.122 Even though these
are
promising, more research is required to elucidate how
alterations in the gut microbiota can affect disease
outcome in other subtypes of IBS. This section has
highlighted how certain microbial communities can lead
to certain end points, such as weight loss and patient
symptomology. However, whether these microbial com-
munities lead to similar end points outside of these
speciﬁc disease states remains unknown and remains an
area of active investigation.

Limitations of Current Methods and
Future Directions

Obesity and IBS are 2 example diseases that highlight
the signiﬁcant gains microbiome research has undergone
in the last decade. Despite those gains, there is still much
more research to be done. To date, much of the current
research in human samples has been predominantly as-
sociation studies, with little insight into the underlying
mechanisms associated with altered gut microbiome and
disease. The limitation of these studies is that they are
unable to clearly state if dysbiosis is a cause of disease or
merely a by-product. Currently, there is an important
shift away from these types of analyses and a move to-
ward investigations to deﬁne mechanisms by using
germ-free animals and multi’omics analysis.5 By starting
with a multi’omics approach that
integrates metab-
olomics, proteomics, and 16S rRNA analysis, for example,

researchers
can more clearly postulate microbial-
dependent mechanistic pathways that lead to disease.
By recapitulating the disease phenotype through micro-
bial transplantation in germ-free animal models, re-
searchers can then clearly model out the direct causative
effects of dysbiosis to disease development. Even though
most mechanistic studies have been done in animals, the
observations seen in animal models and how they have
correlated in humans have provided a deeper under-
standing of microbial-host signaling and pathogenesis of
diseases. Future research may also focus on the interplay
between the microbiome and epigenetics. There is an
emerging body of literature on the role of transgenera-
tional epigenetic inheritance on health and disease.123 As
reviewed here, stress and the environment play a major
role in the development and stability of the microbiome
over time. But exactly how these signals can alter host
epigenetics, particularly across generations, is an active
area of research.

The other current limitation in the ﬁeld is the lack of
standardization across similar studies or even across
same disease groups. Currently,
there are not any
deﬁnitive studies on how microbial analysis differ across
the various sampling techniques and the many analytical
pipelines. For example, it is difﬁcult to compare studies
of similar patients if sampling was done using differing
methods, such as via fresh or frozen stool collection,
endoscopic aspiration, or via mucosal scrapings/biopsy.
As the ﬁeld matures, sample collection and processing
need to be standardized to ensure reproducibility and to
allow researchers to readily compare outcomes across
different studies using different patient groups.

analysis.5 However,

involves cheaper sequencing
technology to obtain strain-level data. 16S rRNA
sequencing is currently the most commonly used method
for microbiome
rRNA
sequencing is only able to obtain species-level resolution.
Because of horizontal gene transfer, bacterial genomes of
strains even within the same species can be potentially
diverse.124 Although shotgun sequencing is available and
able to provide strain-level resolution, it is out of reach
for many because of its high costs. But with greater ad-
vances in sequencing technology,
this cost may be
reduced enough for widespread use in the future.125
Even though there is a long way to go, improvements
in sequencing throughput and accuracy, complemented
by an upsurge of novel bioinformatics analysis of pro-
teomes, metabolomes, and transcriptomes, has brought
the ﬁeld closer to a better understanding of human dis-
ease and treatment.

Conclusions

The microbiome is a complex system at the inter-
section of environment and health. Although many as-
the environment can cause shifts in the
pects of
microbiome, we see through the example of obesity and

IBS that the perturbations of this intricate system can
also be at the core of disease. Even though longitudinal
studies are still required to determine the direct rela-
tionship between environmental factors and gut dys-
biosis with disease development,
improvements in
sequencing technology and an ever-growing ﬁeld of
bioinformatics are providing new daily insights on how
environment, heath, and microbes are linked. This has
implications for not only better understanding the un-
derlying pathophysiology of disease but can also help
better develop targeted treatments based on speciﬁc
microbial molecules.
