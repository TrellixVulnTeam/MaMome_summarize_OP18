Competing interests: The authors have declared
that no competing interests exist. The first 50 consecutive sub-
jects who met both the criteria for GDM according to international guidelines (fasting plasma
glucose �92 mg/dL and/or 1h post-test glycemia �180 mg/dL and/or 2h post-test glycemia
�153 mg/dL) and the inclusion criteria (see below) were enrolled  Out of them, 41
women participated in an observational study aiming to evaluate the changes in gut micro-
biota composition across pregnancy  The fecal samples of their offspring were collected in
the first week of life. PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0226545 December 16, 2019

GDM offspring gut microbiota composition

The post-hoc power estimated on partial R2 according to the multivariate linear regression
model adjusted for maternal weight change, breastfeeding and Cesarean section was 0.80 with
α = 0.05. The correlation plot between
maternal nutrient intakes and infant gut microbiota showed a higher number of significant
associations with maternal variables at enrolment than at the study-end (Fig 3). Gut microbiota signature at sub-genus level

In order to explore the possible mother-to-infant gut microbiota transmission at sub-OTUs
level, we carried out oligotyping on sequences of Blautia, Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium
since these were the only genera showing a Shannon entropy index sufficient to identify all
