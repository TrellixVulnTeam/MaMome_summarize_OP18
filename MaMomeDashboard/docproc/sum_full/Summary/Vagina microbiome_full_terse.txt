riage patterns far exceeded what was initially
suspected (Aagaard et al. Our laboratory and others have shown that
the vaginal microbiota vary in association with
normal pregnancy, thus providing a unique
“signature” in pregnancy with relative alter-
ed abundance of multiple taxa (Aagaard et al. 2014b Colon, anus,

16S-Based Metagenomics

Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene using Next-
Gen technology has recently been widely ex-
ploited to characterize the human microbiome
(Jonasson et al. An additional method that may be use-
ful to examine microbiome communities across
ethnicities is to use single nucleotide poly-
morphisms (SNPs) in mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA), which provides more precision in
analysis (Ruiz-Pesini et al. We have re-
cently used this method in conjunction with
analysis of the microbiome through data lever-
aged from the HMP to examine associations

A.L. Prince et al. THE VAGINAL MICROBIOME IN
PREGNANCY

With the demonstration that the vaginal micro-
biome ﬂuctuates based on the menstrual cycle,
with intercourse, and (to a much more limited
degree) with clinical symptoms of BV, we and
others sought to characterize the vaginal micro-
biome during pregnancy.
