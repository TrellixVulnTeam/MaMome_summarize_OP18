The human vaginal microbiome maintains low diversity in low-pH conditions and
depends on host sugars as carbon sources, with less access to dietary and exogenous
nutrients than the gut, skin, or oral cavity. Historically, vaginal microbial communities
have been stratiﬁed based on hierarchical clustering of the taxa composition 
Keystone species include Lactobacillus crispatus and Lactobacillus gasseri, which have
been associated with maintenance of a simple vaginal microbiome by their production
of bacteriostatic and bactericidal compounds (e.g., lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide)
and maintenance of a low pH numerically and functionally dominating their
respective vaginal communities. This association between the most abundant bacterial taxa and
microbial composition of the sample was signiﬁcant and explained more than half
of the variance using permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA)
(R2 (cid:2) 56%; P (cid:2) 0.0001). Detected
ions by MALDI were compared to those identiﬁed by GC-MS and LC-MS, and we found
that (cid:4)55% of the metabolites identiﬁed had corresponding ions in the MALDI analysis
(Table S1)..

Metagenomics and functional potential of communities. Indeed,
L. crispatus has been shown to have anti-Candida activity of
samples that were Candida positive came from individuals whose vaginal microbiota
were dominated by an organism other than L. crispatus..

A few metabolites were highly indicative of the bacterial community present in each
subject and may be useful biomarkers for the type of vaginal microbiota present.
