in  phylum-  or  genus-level  relative  abundance  between  diet  arms, 
with the exception of the Verrucomicrobia phylum which was sig-
nificantly  increased  during  UF  (Extended  Data  Fig. This  analysis  revealed  nine  bacte-
rial  species  that  were  significantly  different  between  the  two  diet 
arms , including an enrichment 
for A. muciniphila during UF, consistent with our 16S rRNA gene

Oscillibacter sp. Each data point represents the mean value of samples from each subject (n = 70 samples from 24 
subjects). Two bacterial 
species consistently changed in response to both perturbations: A. muciniphila and an unidentified species belonging to Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group..

Our  results  provide  insights  into  potential  mechanisms  that 
could explain the increased stool calories loss.
