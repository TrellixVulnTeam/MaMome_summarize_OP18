of intravaginal nonoxyl-9 (an ingredient in spermicide and a commonly used cytotoxic control) and univer-
sal placebo gel (isotonic) found that both have inflammatory effects on cells of the cervix and endometrium12. While these products 
have been shown to negatively impact cells of the female reproductive tract, little is known about how vaginal 
lubricants impact potentially protective Lactobacillus spp. However, in the presence of human vaginal 
epithelial cells, E. coli demonstrated no inhibition in the presence of KY Jelly, and increased growth with Replens 
Long-Lasting and Trimo-San compared to control (p < 0.05, Fig. L. crispatus growth was stimulated by Replens Silky Smooth (p < 0.01). b) Final change in growth of 
L. crispatus, as measured in CFU (in 1:100 diluted product and MRS/KSF cell culture media as control), 
demonstrating a lack of inhibition by KY Jelly, Replens Long-Lasting moisturizer and Trimo-San, regardless of 
the presence of human vaginal epithelial cells (p > 0.05). After a 24-hour equilibration to allow vaginal cells to adhere to the plate and become confluent, 25 µL of the 
laboratory strain E. coli suspended in KSF were added to the vaginal epithelial cells with 75 µL of fresh KSF media 
and incubated for 1 hour.
