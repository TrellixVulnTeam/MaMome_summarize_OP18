determinant of oﬀspring health  and that potentially determines the development of atopy and
autoimmune phenotypes in the oﬀspring  However, the relationship among the immune system,
the gut microbiota, and metabolism in pregnancy is unclear, and more research is needed to stablish
ﬁnal conclusions. These studies have shown that the intestinal microbiota of critical patients
has low diversity, with a shortage of key commensal bacteria and overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria
such as Clostridium diﬃcile, and some species of Enteococcus, Escherichia and Shigella 
In addition, the microbiota changes throughout the stay in the intensive care units (ICU)  and the
possibility of pathogenic colonization increases with the time of stay in the unit. These authors have observed a characteristic
depletion of dihomo-γ-linoleate, a precursor of anti-inﬂammatory ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid and
prostaglandins that may be related
