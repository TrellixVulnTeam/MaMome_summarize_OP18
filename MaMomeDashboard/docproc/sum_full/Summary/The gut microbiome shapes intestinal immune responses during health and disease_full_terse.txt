inflammation and regulation in the gut may be due to the community structure of the
microbiota. Some have predicted that IBD, at least in
part, results from an imbalance in the normal microbiota (termed dysbiosis) without
acquisition of an infectious agent64. Moreover, depletion of the CD4+CD25+ T-cell subset
abolished the ability of the probiotic-treated DCs to protect from disease, suggesting that L.
rhamnosus-treated DCs can initiate TReg-cell activity79. These data have identified a single molecule made by a
symbiotic microorganism that stimulates CD4+ T cells to make IL-10, required for the
suppression of the inflammatory process during colitis, and suggest that other beneficial
bacteria may produce factors that can positively shape the host immune response during
IBD.
