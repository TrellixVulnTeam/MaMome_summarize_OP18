Gut Microbiota Metabolome

diseases may develop (Putignani et al., 2015), such as allergy,
inﬂammatory bowel disease
and
diabetes, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular dyslipidemia,
and neuropathology (Holmes et al., (IBD), obesity,

cancer

The advent of the omics-based systems biology era has opened
a new scenario in the comprehension of the gut ecosystem
by shedding light on its shape, modulation and interplay with
microorganisms, food functionality, and the role of nutrients in
health (Moco et al., In particular, the use of metabolomics, being a well-
established and powerful top–down systems biology approach,
is crucial to unravel the genetics–environment–health relation,
as well as the typical clinical biomarkers of the diﬀerent diseases
(Moco et al., In fact, metabolomics changed the concept
that the cellular metabolism proﬁle is complete (Dettmer et al., Therefore, metabolomics is useful to elucidate the complex
interactions of components, to understand the whole system, and
to discover new metabolites in order to provide both a diﬀerent
perspective on cellular homeostasis (Liu et al., 2010), and new,
unexpected pathways which may have a key physiological role
(Zamboni et al., The metabolomics experiment (sampling,
sample preparation, instrumental analysis, data processing, and
data interpretation) fulﬁll the goal of improving the current
status of biological information associated to the metabolome
and, more generally, to functional genomics (Harrigan and
Goodacre, 2003). Nowadays, metabolomics is used to: (i) identify
biomarkers that could indicate the presence of a diseases, or
a response to drug intervention (Dunn and Ellis, 2005); (ii)
determine biochemical or environmental stresses (Le Gall et al., 2003); (iii) characterize microbial metabolism (Vaidyanathan
et al., 2002); and (iv) characterize human health or disease
(Holmes et al., Indeed, the metabolomics approach has been applied to
several studies on the gut microbiota, mostly focused on the
exploration of disease-related metabolites in order to obtain
detailed information on the gut metabolic pathways. In fact,
the gut microbiota is involved in several biochemical functions
directly associated to the perturbation of speciﬁc gut microbial
populations, which may lead to the development of diseases
(De Preter, 2015; De Preter et al., 2012) the study of its composition helps
discriminate between unhealthy and healthy subjects. Moreover, the identiﬁcation of metabolites may highlight
how lifestyle and dietary habits aﬀect speciﬁc disease conditions
(Vernocchi et al., Finally, metabolomics represents an unprecedented approach
to collect the complex metabolic interactions between the host
and its commensal microbial partners, oﬀering the opportunity
to deﬁne individual and population phenotypes (Moco et al., In fact, several cellular metabolites are associated with

the phenotypes of living organisms (i.e., human, mice, bacteria),
and they represent the substrates and products of diﬀerent
biochemical pathways reﬂecting genetic and environmental
factors (Kim et al., However, due to the chemical diversity,

the diﬀerent
properties of metabolites, and the large dynamic range of
metabolite concentrations in samples, it is almost impossible to
measure the complete metabolome with only one technique (De
Preter and Verbeke, 2013; Smirnov et al., Considering
that the amount of predictable metabolites and derivatives in
mammals, plants and bacteria is unknown (Weckwerth and
Morgenthal, 2005), there is the need of diﬀerent analytical
platforms and complex integrated computational pipelines,
to cover
adjusted by analytical and chemical parameters,
complete metabolome pathways
in the diﬀerent bioﬂuids
(Savorani et al., Besides,
the
storage and the continuous sample freeze/thawing may alter the
composition and stability of the samples and consequently the
precision and accuracy of results (Roessner et al., Finally,

the fundamental requirements of metabolomics
studies are: accurate study design; sample treatment and platform
set up, corroborated by data analysis; integration of results; and
biological interpretation (Smirnov et al., Metabolomics can be divided into two diﬀerent groups:
targeted analysis and non-targeted discovery analysis (Dettmer
et al., Detection Methods
At present, we are able to separate, detect, characterize,
and quantify metabolites
relevant metabolic
pathways thanks to the rapid development of a range of
