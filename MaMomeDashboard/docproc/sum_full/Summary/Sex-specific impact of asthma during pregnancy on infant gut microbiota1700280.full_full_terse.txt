Introduction
Asthma is a common chronic disorder during pregnancy, affecting between 8% and 13% of pregnant
women 
is often a comorbid condition with food and environmental allergies  Asthma
exacerbation rates during pregnancy are high  and more severe asthma or poor symptom control have
been associated with low birthweight  A greater risk for childhood asthma following uncontrolled
versus controlled maternal asthma during pregnancy has been reported  These variations in risk to the
offspring point to a potential in utero influence of maternal asthma. Restriction to Caucasian ethnicity also allowed us to test
associations within a population at highest risk for infant wheeze: male Caucasian infants 

To test the a priori research question on infant sex and adjust for putative confounding factors, analyses
were stratified by infant sex, birth mode, breastfeeding status and intrapartum antibiotic exposure (also a
strong marker for infant antibiotic use; . Comparisons were performed
using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. The p-values <0.1 are reported and
p-values <0.05 are indicated in bold. ¶: While no prior evidence exists for maternal prenatal asthma,
these findings are compatible with the reduced Lactobacillales abundance observed in the meconium of
newborns of mothers with eczema, and lower faecal colonisation with Lactobacillus species in infants of
atopic parents  In our study, male infants born to mothers with prenatal asthma were one-third
(aOR 0.26, 95% CI: 0.07–0.89) as likely to be colonised with high levels of lactobacilli, independent of
maternal overweight or atopy status, birth mode or infant diet. Indeed, risk for atopic sensitisation at age 5 is reportedly
elevated, with lower Lactobacillus colonisation by the age of 2 months in infants born to atopic parents 
Other high-risk cohort studies have found discordant faecal microbial biomarkers for atopic disease, such as

lactobacilli
