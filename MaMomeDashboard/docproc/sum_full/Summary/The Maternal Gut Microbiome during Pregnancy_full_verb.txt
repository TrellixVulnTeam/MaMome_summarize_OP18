environmental exposures (Brown et al., The focus of this review, therefore, is the gut microbiome as it is 
commonly defined, limited to the intestines. The gut microbiome provides a broad range of functions. An individual’s systemic and intestinal immune systems 
depend greatly on the gut microbiome’s function of epithelial cell renewal and management 
of intestinal integrity (Power et al., This migration occurs through a mechanism of intestinal permeability sometimes 
referred to as “leaky gut” (Power et al., With leaky gut, junctions, composed of 
various proteins that link adjacent intestinal epithelial cells, are weak and fail to act as an 
integral barrier to migrating pathogens (Power et al., Anti-
inflammatory properties exist at the placental bed which protects the fetus from rejection, 
yet the mucosal surfaces of the gut and other tissues experience a low-grade inflammation 
with rising levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and white cells as the pregnancy advances 
(Koren et al., When conditions like maternal obesity, gestational diabetes or a leaky 
gut shift the maternal inflammatory state from a physiologic to an excessive level, vascular 
dysfunction of the placental tissue can develop leading to deleterious effects such as fetal 
growth restriction and preeclampsia (Kashtanova et al., 2016; Kim, Romero, 
Chaemsaithong, & Kim, 2015). Author manuscript; available in PMC 2018 November 01. Author Manuscript

The gut microbiome is also shaped by diet and genetics. Conversely, certain 
dietary nutrients, namely low-fat protein (for instance beans, skinless chicken, lean beef), 
organic proteins and produce (which reduces exposure to dietary antibiotics and pesticides), 
unsaturated fatty acids (for instance in canola and olive oils, flaxseeds, and salmon), whole 
grains, and certain strains of probiotics have been found to promote a healthy gut 
microbiome, enhance intestinal integrity and reduce excessive systemic inflammation 
(Griffin, 2015; Kashtanova et al., Short chain fatty acids (SCFA), such as acetate, 
propionate and butyrate, are byproducts of fiber fermentation called prebiotics and serve as 
an energy source to intestinal epithelial cells and enhance the connections between these 
cells (David et al., Increased maternal serum SCFA levels 
can positively influence metabolic changes seen in pregnancy: maternal weight gain, glucose 
metabolism and levels of various metabolic hormones (Koren et al., In a healthy 

MCN Am J Matern Child Nurs. Disproportionate rates of infections have been found in chronically 
stressed minority populations and are thought to be a source of higher rates of preterm birth 
in these populations through dysbiotic gut microbe translocation mechanisms previously 
described (Culhane, Rauh, & Goldenberg, 2006; Mendez, Hogan, & Culhane, 2014). Yet, as the pregnancy advances, the abundance of gut bacteria associated with 
inflammatory states increases in nearly 70% of women (Santacruz et al., Negative 
interference with the brain-gut axis (depicted on right side of Figure 1) during these times is 
associated with a higher maternal and child risk for chronic intestinal disorders, conditions 
which affect weight and growth, and even neuropsychiatric disorders (Mayer, Knight, et al., Health care recommendations that promote the IOM guidelines for maternal weight 
gain by prepregnant BMI category, high quality diet and gut eubiosis should be considered 
in the delivery of prenatal care and in client education. Appropriate 
type, duration and indication of prebiotic, probiotic and antibiotic use in the prevention and 
treatment of illness will become an important topic for discussion with clients in the future, 
since all act on the gut microbiome and may impact overall health and gestational weight 
gain (Griffin, 2015). There are no current clinical guidelines to facilitate these discussions 
pending further research. In a recent clinical trial, supplementation with specific strains of probiotics, such as 
Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Lactobacillus acidophilus, combined with dietary 
counseling have been found to improve glucose metabolism in healthy pregnant and 
lactating women (Brantsaeter et al., Lactose intolerance can often be managed by ingestion of lactase enzymes with the 
dairy or by limiting intake to lactose-free dairy products. Probiotic milk and other food products may, therefore, be worth consideration 
for women at greater risk for gestational diabetes, preeclampsia and some environmental 
toxins.
