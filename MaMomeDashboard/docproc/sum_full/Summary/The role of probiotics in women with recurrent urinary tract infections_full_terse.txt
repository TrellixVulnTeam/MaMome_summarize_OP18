Among  these  treatment  approaches,  probiotic  applications  are 
among the promising alternatives. It has been shown that healthy 
microbial  populations  of  Lactobacillus  species  have  a  strong 
inhibitory effect on E. coliInfections treated using antibiotics 
reduce drug abuse, leading to drug resistance and render the nat-
ural barrier of the urinary system vulnerable to infections. UMs of prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethox-
azole treatment, and healthy control group were compared and it 
was shown that the the number of pathogenic species in the anti-
biotic group significantly increased while microbial diversities

decreased  relative  to  the  healthy  control  group These  findings 
support  the  necessity  of  demonstrating  sensitivity  in  selecting 
optimal  prophylactic  regimens  and  suggest  that  probiotic  pro-
phylaxis can be considered more effectively. Abad  and  Safdar  reviewed  25  clinical  trials  in  a  systematic 
review  they  published  in  2009  and  investigated  the  presence  of 
Lactobacillus-containing probiotics in the prevention and treatment 
of urogenital infections. Vaginal ovule containing 
L. crispatus, and placebo 
were applied for 10 weeks in 
patients who did not receive 
UTI treatment within the 
previous 12, and a significant 
decrease in disease was 
observed in the probiotic group 

Akg√ºl and Karakan. Oral, vaginal, and liquid formulations 
are being used.
