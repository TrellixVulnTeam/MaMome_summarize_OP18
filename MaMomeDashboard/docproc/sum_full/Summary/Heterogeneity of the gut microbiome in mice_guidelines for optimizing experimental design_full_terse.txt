FEMS Microbiology Reviews, 2016, Vol. TOOLS TO DISSECT THE ROLE OF THE GUT
MICROBIOME IN MICE

Most studies that address the causal relationship between the
presence of bacteria and host physiology have been based on
rather extreme changes in microbiota, such as the use of germ-
free (GF) mice, which are born and reared without exposure to
any live microbes, and treatment with broad-spectrum antibi-
otics. They consume oxygen leading to a
drop in redox potential, as such creating an appropriate en-
vironment for anaerobic colonization such as Clostridia and

FEMS Microbiology Reviews, 2016, Vol. Also of concern are the differences in func-
tional biochemical activities of the microbiota of mice raised
under SPF conditions or under conventional conditions (Norin
and Midtvedt 2010). However, cohousing of mice with dif-
ferent genotypes (e.g. wild type and knockout) has been shown
to change the gut microbial composition, affecting their natu-
ral immunological responses to a treatment or a disease trigger
