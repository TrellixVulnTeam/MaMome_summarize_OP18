Number of taxa at different ranks

Taxonomy

No. For the tests described here,
the Bergey corpus was used as the database, and a query was assigned to the
same genus as the closest-matching sequence from the Bergey corpus (effec-
tively, k (cid:2) 1). For these high-throughput experiments,
the RDP Classiﬁer can provide rapid taxonomic placement and
summary data, including the number of input sequences be-
longing to each taxon. Unlike the Seq-
Match nearest-neighbor classiﬁer, the RDP naı¨ve Bayesian
Classiﬁer uses information averaged over the entire genus and
hence is less inﬂuenced by individual misplaced training se-
quences. Sequences for each of the
11 species type strains of Alicyclobacillaceae available in release 5.0 of
Bergey’s taxonomic outline, along with additional sequences for four
Alicyclobacillaceae species type strains that became available after the
release of the outline (marked with an asterisk), and two Bacillus
species type strains were analyzed using the weighted neighbor-joining
method  The tree is rooted using Escherichia coli sequence J01695
as the outgroup. We chose to use SeqMatch for the comparison, because it, like
the RDP Classiﬁer, is offered through the RDP.
