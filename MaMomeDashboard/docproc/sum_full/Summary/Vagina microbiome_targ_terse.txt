ly published this 16S-based metagenomic char-
acterization in a cross-sectional study (Aagaard
et al. pared with the HMP nonpregnant reference
subjects, we found that pregnancy was associat-

sequencing platforms used in these separate
studies prevented in depth analysis (Romero

When directly examining the intestinal mi-
crobiome of infants born via cesarean or vaginal
delivery, culture-based microbiological tech-
niques have shown differences in the coloniza-
tion of the neonatal
intestinal microbiome,
particularly of Biﬁdobacterium-like bacteria,
Lactobacillus-like bacteria, and Bacteriodes fra-
gilis (Gro¨nlund et al. Our ﬁnding of Fuso-
bacteria to be a relatively abundant taxon in the
placenta supports the hypothesis of hematoge-
nous spread from the oral cavity to the placenta
