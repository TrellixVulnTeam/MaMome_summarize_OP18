The human vaginal microbiome maintains low diversity in low-pH conditions and
depends on host sugars as carbon sources, with less access to dietary and exogenous
nutrients than the gut, skin, or oral cavity. In 12 samples from 7 subjects, a Lactobacillus taxon, putatively
identiﬁed as L. crispatus through metagenomic sequencing , had a
median relative abundance of 96% and persisted at a relative abundance greater than
90% in subjects 1088, 1120, and 1191. Most of the reads classiﬁed as L. crispatus or L. iners mapped to a single metagenomic
assembled genome, with completeness of 95.7% and 97.1% and redundancy of 0% and
1.4%, respectively..

Highly abundant bacterial taxa were signiﬁcantly associated with community
composition. In parallel, we found that
a pathway for mannitol-1-phosphate production is also more abundant in shotgun
metagenomic data sets of CVF samples dominated by L. crispatus . Detected
ions by MALDI were compared to those identiﬁed by GC-MS and LC-MS, and we found
that (cid:4)55% of the metabolites identiﬁed had corresponding ions in the MALDI analysis
(Table S1)..

Metagenomics and functional potential of communities. Further, metabolomic analysis of
our CVF samples failed to capture signiﬁcant levels of the mannitol precursor fructose;
however, previous studies have indicated an appreciable amount of fructose within the
cervical mucus of humans and the capability of L. crispatus to utilize fructose as a
carbon source  We speculate that this high extracellular mannitol abundance
phenotype may underlie the cell’s need to regenerate NAD(cid:5) for use in glycolysis.
