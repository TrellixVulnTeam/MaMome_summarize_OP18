Characterizing the microbiome

Tools for studying the metagenome

individuals, and possibly, their disease risks. By categorizing metagenomic sequences based on

Nat Rev Genet. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2012 October 01. Caesarian section instead of vaginal delivery is an
obvious example of the potential impact of medical practice on microbiota composition,
with substantial differences in founding population54, that may persist for months56 (Figure
3). In many host species, paternal contributions to offspring traits have been well
documented57,58; these observations have been extended to the microbiome, where paternal
contributions to offspring H. pylori allele composition have been shown59, In any event,
there is evidence for extensive horizontal gene transfer (HGT) within human populations,
functional classes, and ecological niches60, indicating the site-specificity and dynamism of
selection on the human microbiome. Dissimilarity of <1% in 16S rRNA sequences has
commonly been used to define an OTU but <3% and <5% have also
been used

An exclusivity scenario in which the abundance of one species leads
to another species being less abundant than would be expected by
chance
