Abstract: Pregnancy induces a number of immunological, hormonal, and metabolic changes that are
necessary for the mother to adapt her body to this new physiological situation. argued the weakness of evidence supporting the. However, recent data have questioned
the traditional accepted dogma of human microbiome acquisition, proposing that neither the placenta,
the amniotic ﬂuid, nor the fetus are sterile..

However, it is unclear where the fetal microbiota comes from, and when is the ﬁrst fetal exposition. Furthermore, bacterial richness and diversity were lower in the infant gut of babies born after
elective C-section and higher in emergency C-section, suggesting that colonization may be aﬀected
diﬀerently in both situations. In contrast, Paenibacillus predominated in term placental specimens 
Other authors have proposed that the fetal intestinal microbiota derives from swallowed amniotic ﬂuid,
and that they may trigger an inﬂammatory response which leads to premature birth  Considering
that some Lactobacillus strains may possess potential anti-inﬂammatory activities, and could regulate
blood glucose levels in diabetic humans  the low abundance of Lactobacillus in placentas of low
birth weight neonates reported by Zheng et al.
