is diet, an element which we can control. However, twelve weeks of oligofructose consumption at the same quantity
in obese and overweight children, aged 7–11 years 
in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial had no impact on body weight and body fat 

Consumption of inulin-type fructans by obese women at 16 g/day for 3 months led to gut
microbiota changes which included an increase in Biﬁdobacterium and F. prausnitzii, both of which
negatively correlated with serum lipopolysaccharides The prebiotic also decreased Bacteroides
intestinalis, Bac. In a later randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo controlled trial,
obese women consuming the same prebiotic at the same concentration for three months had signiﬁcantly
lower total SCFAs, acetate and propionate (that positively correlated with BMI), as well as signiﬁcantly
lower fasting insulinemia and homeostasis model assessment (indicator of insulin resistance) compared
to the placebo group  The following species were signiﬁcantly increased in the prebiotic group
at the end of the three months, Biﬁdobacterium adolescentis, Biﬁdobacterium pseudocatenulatum and Bif. Nutrients 2019, 11, 1468

In a study investigating the existence of a correlation between body weight change over time and
gut microbiome composition involving 1632 healthy females from TwinsUK, (national register of adult
twins for studying age-related complex traits and disease), Menni et al. Another example is
the direct modulation of colonic microbiota with short-chain GOS to metabolize lactose in lactose
intolerant individuals  In this case, GOS failed to elicit a biﬁdogenic response in three out of
30 participants; however, an increase in biﬁdobacteria was associated with a decrease in pain and
cramping revealing its signiﬁcance in terms of symptoms. While the analysis is capable of providing an insight
into the necessary dietary recommendations to achieve a ‘healthy’ gut microbiome, one must question
the utility of this information at present given that we have yet to deﬁne a universal ‘healthy’ gut
microbiome, which may not be possible given the suspected level of speciﬁcity that can be associated
with an individual’s ‘healthy’ gut.
