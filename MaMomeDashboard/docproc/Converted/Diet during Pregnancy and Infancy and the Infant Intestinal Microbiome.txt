Trial enrolled 881 pregnant women at 3 clinical sites in the US
(Boston, Massachusetts; St. Louis, Missouri; and San Diego,
California). Inclusion criteria included a personal history of
asthma or allergy in the pregnant woman or in the father of
the fetus. The intervention phase occurred during preg-
nancy, and after birth infants were followed every 3 months
for the development of respiratory disease and other outcomes.
An ancillary study of the child intestinal microbiome was
initiated during follow-up, after roughly one-half of the chil-
dren reached 3 months of age. Stool samples were collected
from infants between age 3 and 6 months. Caretakers were in-
structed to collect approximately 2.5 milliliters of child stool
from a diaper using a tongue depressor 1-2 days prior to a study
visit and to store the sample in a home freezer until bringing
it to the visit in a freezer pack. The only exclusion criterion
for stool collection was antibiotic use by the infant in the prior
7 days. The study followed procedures in accordance with the
ethical standards of the participating institutions, and ap-
proval was obtained from the institutions’ committees on
human subjects.

A validated, abbreviated food frequency questionnaire asking
pregnant women how often they ate a food or food group was
obtained at enrollment and in the third trimester.16 Principal
components (PCs) analysis was used to reduce the maternal
diet to fewer variables. The top principal component was used
in regression models.

Questions regarding the child diet were asked beginning at
age 6 months. We used responses obtained at the 6 month ques-
tionnaire (or later if 6-month data was incomplete or missing)
to ascertain the infant diet at the time of the stool collection.

feeding, or solid food status (Appendix; available at

able at www.jpeds.com).

Sequencing of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA was per-
formed using the Roche 454 Titanium platform (454 Life Sci-
ences, Branford, Connecticut). Filtering, trimming, and chimera
checking were performed as previously described.17,18 Se-
quences were grouped according to similarity using closed ref-
erence operational taxonomic unit classiﬁcation in Qiime.19
High quality reads were classiﬁed from phylum to genus level
at a conﬁdence threshold of 0.5 using the Ribosomal Data-
base Project Naive Bayesian Classiﬁer v 2.2, training set 6.20,21
Samples were scaled to 1000 reads prior to analysis. To ﬁt model
assumptions, read counts were used in multivariable regres-
sion models. Operational taxonomic units identiﬁed at least
10 times in at least 10 subjects were used in microbiome-
wide analyses.

Statistical Analyses
We chose 4 genera to evaluate in detail based on prior infant
feeding studies and associations with health outcomes7-10,22-25:
Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, Biﬁdobacterium, and Clostridium. We
calculated the Shannon diversity index and richness (total
number of taxa identiﬁed), which have been generally asso-
ciated with positive health outcomes. We used simple and mul-
tivariable linear and negative binomial regression to determine

2

the association between maternal and child diet and these
outcomes. Covariates in multivariable analysis, chosen on the
basis of prior studies,7,11 included mode of delivery, child race/
ethnicity (African American, Hispanic, white, other), age at stool
collection, treatment arm, and maternal education. House-
hold income was not included because 22% of subjects did not
know or preferred not to report household income.

We explored whether there were differences in the infant
microbiome response to diet by including an interaction term
between race/ethnicity and breast milk vs formula in regres-
sion models and by stratifying by race/ethnicity if an inter-
action was found. Cut-off P values for statistical signiﬁcance
were selected a priori. P values of .05 or less indicated signiﬁ-
cance. All analyses were performed in Stata/IC v 12 (StataCorp,
College Station, Texas) and R (packages VEGAN, The R Foun-
dation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Missing data
were considered missing at random and complete case analy-
sis was employed.

We used Multivariate Association with Linear Models26 to
analyze associations between breastfeeding vs formula feeding
and individual bacterial genera in a microbiome-wide analy-
sis stratiﬁed by race/ethnicity. Analysis covariates were the same
as for multivariable regression analyses described above, and
results were considered signiﬁcant at a false discovery rate of
.05 or less.

Results

A total of 323 infants had stool sample microbiome sequenc-
ing data and known breastfeeding vs formula feeding status
(Figure 1); 95 infants were exclusively breastfed, and 169 were
exclusively formula fed at the time of the stool collection. As
shown in Table I, infants who were breastfed were more likely
to be delivered vaginally (74% vs 62%), more likely to be His-
panic (39% vs 25%) or white (37% vs 9%) than African Ameri-
can (16% vs 62%), and less likely to have had solid food
introduced into their diet by the time of stool collection (33%
vs 48%) compared with formula-fed infants. Infants who were
breastfed had mothers with higher educational levels (P < .001)
and higher household incomes (P < .001).

We analyzed maternal diet as the ﬁrst principal compo-
nent of the maternal food frequency questionnaire responses,
which represented high intake of vegetables and low intake of
processed meats and deep fried foods (Tables II and III; avail-
able at www.jpeds.com). In unadjusted analyses, high intake
of vegetables and low intake of processed meats and deep fried
foods during pregnancy was positively associated with Shannon
diversity index (increase of 0.08 for every 1 increase in the ﬁrst
PC (PC 1); P < .001) and richness (increase of 1.56 for every
1 increase in PC 1; P < .001; Table IV). However, in models
adjusted for demographic and other dietary characteristics, these
differences were no longer statistically signiﬁcant.

In unadjusted analyses of 4 genera selected a priori based
on prior literature suggesting associations with early diet and
health outcomes,7-10,22-25 we found that high maternal intake
of vegetables and low intake of processed meats and deep fried
foods was inversely associated with Bacteroides spp (decrease

in 0.19 log counts for every 1 increase in PC 1; P = .03) and
Clostridium spp (decrease in 0.15 log counts for every 1 increase
in PC 1; P = .03) counts (Table IV). However, after adjusting
for demographic variables (mode of delivery, age, treatment,
maternal education, and race/ethnicity), breastfeeding vs
formula feeding and solid food introduction, the only asso-
ciation between the maternal diet and taxa selected a priori
for analysis was a positive association with Lactobacillus spp
(mean difference = 0.48; P = .02).

We did not ﬁnd associations between the second principal
component of the maternal diet (representing high pasta, rice,
and noodle intake) and diversity or these 4 genera.

In crude analyses, both the Shannon diversity index and rich-
ness were signiﬁcantly lower among breastfed infants com-
pared with formula-fed infants (1.92 ± 0.42 vs 2.37 ± 0.36,
P < .001; and 26.5 ± 7.13 vs 34.8 ± 6.40, P < .001, respectively,
Table IV). These differences remained after adjustment for de-
mographic and other dietary variables. In analyses of genera
selected a priori for analysis, adjusted for demographic factors,
we observed signiﬁcantly higher relative abundances of
Biﬁdobacterium spp (mean difference 0.51; P = .02), Lactoba-
cillus spp (mean difference 3.87; P < .001), and Clostridium spp
(mean difference 0.75; P = .05) among breastfed vs formula-
fed infants. Results were similar after adding solid foods and
maternal diet as covariates to the adjusted model.

In unadjusted analyses, both the Shannon diversity index
and richness were signiﬁcantly higher among infants who had
solid foods introduced by the time of the stool collection com-
pared with infants who had not yet had solid foods intro-
duced (2.30 ± 0.43 vs 2.14 ± 0.43, P = .002 and 33.5 ± 7.72 vs

30.5 ± 7.40, P = .001, respectively; Table IV). However, these
differences were attenuated and no longer statistically signiﬁcant
after adjustment for demographic factors alone, and after ad-
justment for demographic and other dietary factors. We did
not detect an association between solid foods and relative abun-
dance of Bacteroides spp, Biﬁdobacterium spp, Lactobacillus spp,
or Clostridia spp in unadjusted analyses. After adjusting for de-
mographic variables, solid food introduction was positively as-
sociated with Clostridium spp (mean difference = 0.80 log
counts; P = .03) and this association remained signiﬁcant after
addition of infant breastfeeding vs formula feeding status and
maternal diet to the adjusted model (mean difference = 0.75
log counts, P = .05).

We next asked whether race/ethnicity inﬂuenced the
association between the infant’s diet and the intestinal
microbiome by including an interaction term between race/
ethnicity and breast milk vs formula in models adjusted for
demographic and other dietary variables. There was no sig-
niﬁcant interaction with regard to Shannon Index (P = .17),
richness (P = .66), Bacteroides spp counts (P = .55), or
Clostridium spp counts (P = .65). There was a trend toward race/
ethnicity × breastfeeding status interactions with regard to
Biﬁdobacterium spp counts (P = .10) and Lactobacillus spp
counts (P = .09). Consequently, we analyzed the association
between breastfeeding status and those taxa (Biﬁdobacterium
and Lactobacillus), stratiﬁed by race/ethnicity. We found that
Biﬁdobacterium spp counts were similar among breastfed and
formula-fed African American infants, and Hispanic and white
breastfed infants had higher levels of Biﬁdobacterium spp com-
pared with formula-fed Hispanic and White infants (African

The PC 1 of maternal diet during pregnancy was dichotomized at its mean for comparisons of low and high groups, and used as a continuous variable in regression models.
Mean, SD for normally distributed variables (Shannon index, Richness).
Median, 25%-75% range for count data.
Linear regression was used in analyses of Shannon Index, and richness and negative binomial regression was used in analysis of bacterial counts. b coefficients of bacterial counts represent a
difference in the log count, formula fed is reference.
The Shannon index is a measure of diversity that accounts both for number of species present and for how evenly distributed bacterial counts are across the species that are present.

†Dietary variables: infant breastfeeding vs formula feeding and infant solid food.
‡Dietary variables: infant solid food and first principal component of maternal diet (high in vegetables and low in processed meats and deep fried foods).
§Dietary variables: infant breastfeeding vs formula feeding and first principal component of maternal diet (high in vegetables and low in processed meats and deep fried foods).

American mean difference = 0.38 log counts, Hispanic mean
difference = 0.52, White mean difference 0.50; Table V and
Figure 2). Conversely, Lactobacillus spp counts tended to be
higher among breastfed African American infants compared
with breastfed Hispanic and White infants (African Ameri-
can mean difference = 6.34 log counts, Hispanic mean
difference = 2.53, White mean difference 3.08; Table V and
Figure 2).

When maternal education was added as a covariate,
the strengths of interactions between breastfeeding vs
formula feeding status and race/ethnicity were weakened
(Biﬁdobacterium spp P = .12; Lactobacillus spp P = .21). Because
maternal education and race/ethnicity were highly associ-
ated (P = < .001 for c2 test), it is likely that interaction strengths
were attenuated due to collinearity. Excluding race/ethnicity
from the model, the interaction between breastfeeding status
and maternal education was not signiﬁcant for either
Biﬁdobacterium spp (P = .45) or Lactobacillus spp (P = .73),
further supporting stronger associations of microbial differ-
ences by infant diet group with race/ethnicity than maternal
education.

We identiﬁed signiﬁcant differences in relative abun-
dances of taxa between breastfed and formula- fed infants in
adjusted analyses stratiﬁed by race/ethnicity (Figure 3 and
Table VI; available at www.jpeds.com). As in our stratiﬁed
analysis of a priori taxa, Lactobacillus spp were signiﬁcantly
enriched in African American and Hispanic infants who are
breastfed. We note overlap and heterogeneity in the response
to breastfeeding among the top associations among taxa and
diet. Among African Americans and Hispanics, Lachnospiraceae
spp and Ruminococcaceae spp are reduced in infants who are
breastfed and Staphylococcus spp are enriched among His-
panic infants who are breastfed and Eubacterium spp are
reduced among White infants who are breastfed. With ma-
ternal education included as a covariate, these results are largely
unchanged (Table VII; available at www.jpeds.com).

Discussion

We conducted a large, prospective study to examine the de-
tailed relationship between child diet in infancy, the mater-
nal diet during pregnancy, and the early infant intestinal

intestinal microbiome. Breastfed infants had higher counts of
genera thought to be beneﬁcial: Biﬁdobacterium, Lactobacillus,
and Clostridia. In analyses stratiﬁed by race/ethnicity, we found
positive associations between ingestion of breast milk (vs
formula) and relative abundances of Lactobacillus spp in African
American and Hispanic infants, and with Staphylococcus spp
in Hispanic subjects. These associations are consistent with ob-
servations that both Lactobacillus and Staphylococcus spp are
present in breast milk and grow in the presence of human milk
oligosaccharides.27-29

Unexpectedly, given that breastfeeding is generally consid-
ered to be health-promoting and greater diversity is thought
to be associated with a healthier microbiome, we found that
breastfed infants had lower measures of intestinal microbial
diversity compared with formula-fed infants. However, this was
also observed in a smaller study of 9 infants10 and suggests that
diversity may not necessarily relate to health in all clinical
settings.

We did not identify a strong association between maternal
diet during pregnancy and the child microbiome during infancy,
suggesting that child’s diet is the more important determinant
of the infant microbiome. Given that we used an abbreviated

assessment tool for maternal diet and that our use of princi-
pal components only captured some of its variability, future
work using a more detailed dietary assessment tool may better
identify associations between the maternal diet during preg-
nancy and the child microbiome.

Comparison of our ﬁndings with those of other studies is
not straightforward due to different ages studied, variable mi-
crobial proﬁling methods, and heterogenous analytic tech-
niques. In an ethnically homogeneous population using targeted
quantitative polymerase chain reaction on stool samples col-
lected at age 1 month, Penders et al showed breastfed infants
had less Clostridia difﬁcile compared with formula-fed infants.7,30
This contrasts with our ﬁnding of a positive association between
breastfeeding and overall Clostridia spp, though we expect that
the inﬂuence of breastfeeding differs among individual species
within this genus. Consistent with our results, breastfeeding
is thought to increase Biﬁdobacterium spp. However, we did
not observe the decrease in Bacteroides spp with breastfeeding
that has been seen in other studies,7,8 possibly because of the
relatively old age of our participants.

We found that racial/ethnic differences in the composi-
tion of the infant intestinal microbiome could be not be fully
explained by differences in diet. Racial/ethnic differences could
be explained by differences in maternal education; however,
given the strong association between race/ethnicity and maternal

education in our sample, this cannot be deﬁnitively con-
cluded. Although our ﬁndings suggest that race/ethnicity modi-
ﬁes the relationship between diet and the microbiome, this
observation needs to be replicated. If conﬁrmed, this relation-
ship may suggest early genetic inﬂuences or other unmeasured
factors in the response of the microbiome to the diet in dif-
ferent ethnic groups.

Our study has limitations. Because infant diet was in-
ferred from questionnaires administered after stool sample
collection, misclassiﬁcation of the exposure may have oc-
curred; however, this would have introduced a null bias. Subjects
who had taken antibiotics in the 7 days leading up to stool
sample collection were not included in this analysis, though
it is possible that exposure to antibiotics earlier in life or
during pregnancy had effects on the microbiome that we
were not able to account for. However, we do not anticipate a
strong association between likelihood of receiving antibiot-
ics and the dietary factors examined here, so any bias is
anticipated to be random and not systematic. Our ﬁndings
may also have limited generalizability: although the popula-
tion studied is diverse, parents were selected with a personal
history of allergy or asthma. It is unknown whether the
microbiome of children with a family history of atopy may
respond differently to diet than children without such a family
history.

In summary, we found that both the maternal diet during
pregnancy and the child diet during infancy are associated
with the infant intestinal microbiome at age 3-6 months,
with the strongest independent associations seen for breast
milk vs formula feeding. Our results suggest that the associa-
tion between infant diet and microbiome composition varies
by race/ethnicity. As knowledge of microbiome-associated
disease pathogenesis continues to accumulate, the associa-
tion between diet and the child intestinal microbiome may
have implications for disease modiﬁcation through nutri-
tional interventions. ■

Maternal Diet. Women were asked how often they added salt
to their food, and how often they ate the following foods or
food groups:

• Carrots
• Margarine
• Eggs
• Low fat milk products
• Whole milk food products
• Deep fried foods
• Processed meats
• Beef, pork, or lamb
• Dark green leafy vegetables
• Baked products
• Citrus fruits
• Pasta, rice or noodles
• Broccoli, cabbage, cauliﬂower, or brussel sprouts
• Whole grain foods
• Seafood
• Other vegetables

Responses were provided on a ﬁve point scale ranging from
less than once per week to twice or more per day. The average
value for the two questionnaires was taken for further analy-
sis. For cases in which information from one questionnaire was
missing, only information from the other questionnaire was
used.

Child Diet. In our previous report of predictors of the infant
intestinal microbiome11 we had deﬁned breastfeeding as
breastfeeding for at least 6 months. For this analysis focused
primarily on the association of nutrition and the intestinal
microbiome, we attempted to determine what diet the child
was consuming at the time the stool was collected.

Breastfeeding. We used questionnaire responses obtained at
6 months to determine whether a child was ingesting breast
milk at the time of stool collection, accounting for the timing
of stool collection in relation to the questionnaire responses.
At the 6 month visit, providers were asked “Since we last spoke
with you, has your baby been breastfed?” If the answer was yes,
they were asked if the baby was still being breastfed. If the
answer was no, they were asked “How old was your baby when

you stopped breastfeeding.” In 21 cases, an age at cessation of
breastfeeding was not available. In these cases, if the stool sample
was collected within 30 days of completing the question-
naire, we assumed the child was on the same diet at the stool
collection as at questionnaire completion. In 3 cases where the
6 month information was missing, we were able to deter-
mine whether a child was on breast milk at the time of the stool
collection from data obtained at later visits (eg, the child was
still breastfeeding at age 12 months). In 4 cases, it was not pos-
sible to determine whether the child was on breast milk at the
time of the stool collection.

Formula Feeding. Similar to the above, we used question-
naire responses obtained at 6 months to determine whether
a child was ingesting formula at the time of stool collection.
At the 6 month visit, providers were asked, since we last
spoke with you, have you fed your baby any infant formula.
If the caretaker answered yes, they were asked “How old was
your baby when you started infant formula (in months),”
and “How many days per week in the past month have you
fed your baby infant formula?” If the child was fed formula 4
or greater days per week on average, they were considered to
have formula in their diet. In 4 cases where 6-month data
was missing, we were able to determine whether a child was
on formula at the time of the stool collection from data
obtained at later visits.

Solid Food. We used the 6-month and 18-month question-
naire data to determine if a child was on solid food at the time
of stool collection. At the 6-month visit, care providers were
asked “Since we last spoke, have you fed your baby any food
other than breast milk or formula?” In those cases where the
stool sample was collected before the questionnaire and the
child was not reported to have introduced solid foods (n = 39)
or the stool sample was collected after the questionnaire and
the child was reported to have introduced solids (n = 77), the
6-month questionnaire responses were used to determine child
diet. At the 18-month visit, the care provider was asked when
solids were introduced and possible answers included “less than
4 months,”“4 months,”“5 months,”“6 months,” and “more than
6 months.” In 3 cases where the 18-month data was missing,
the 6-month responses were used if stool collection occurred
within 30 days of the questionnaire. In 7 cases we were unable
to determine if the child was on solids at the time of the stool
collection using the available data.

PCs analysis using oblique rotation was used to reduce the maternal diet to fewer variables to
reduce multiple testing, summarize correlated dietary variables, and limit the number of covariates
included in adjusted analyses of the association of the child diet and microbiome. The top PC
was used in regression models. The eigenvalue gives a measure of how much variance in the
data is reflected by each principal component. The proportion of variance explained is given
for each PC, in addition to the cumulative variance explained.
