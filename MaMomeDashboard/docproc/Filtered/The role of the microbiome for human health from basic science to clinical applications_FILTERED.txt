Several studies have demonstrated modulation of colonic 
microbiota by prebiotic inulin or inulin-type fructans. Real-
time  polymerase  chain  reaction  (PCR)  identification  of 
selected bacterial species in the feces of human volunteers 
after inulin ingestion showed that the prevalence of Fae-
calibacterium prausnitzii and two Bifidobacterium species, 
B. adolescentis and B. bifidum, increased significantly  
In a placebo-controlled study, dietary inulin-type fructans 
increased the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium spp. and 
F. prausnitzii in obese women  In healthy adults with 
mild constipation, inulin-type fructans increased the relative 
abundance of Anaerostipes, Bilophila and Bifidobacterium 
in feces, and reduced the abundance of Bilophila  Dif-
ferences in selectivity for the fermentation of several car-
bohydrate substrates (lactulose, galacto-oligosaccharides, 
sugar beet pectin and apple fiber) were found between the .

Additional described effects of prebiotics include reduc-
ing  toxins  produced  from  protein  metabolism  in  urine 
(p-cresol and ammonia) and serum (p-cresyl sulphate) 
 and increasing calcium absorption in adolescents [30, 
31]. Prebiotics may also exert beneficial effects on host 
physiology which are independent of the microbiota as dem-
onstrated by in vitro experiments for GOS. These included 
modulation  of  goblet  cells  to  enhance  mucosal  barrier 
function  a direct protective effect on intestinal barrier 
function  and inhibiting adherence of enteropathogenic 
Escherichia coli to Caco-2 enterocyte and Hep-2 epithelial 
cells .

The effects of butyrate on the human colonic mucosa 
were examined following administration of butyrate enemas 
at physiologically relevant concentrations in healthy volun-
teers. Transcription analysis of microbiome revealed that 
butyrate induced differential expression of multiple genes 
involved in fatty acid oxidation, electron transport chain and 
oxidative stress pathways  In addition, butyrate led to 
dose-dependent decreases in visceral sensitivity  How-
ever, butyrate enemas administered to patients with UC in 
clinical remission had relatively minor effects on inflamma-
tory and oxidative stress parameters, although the selection 
of patients with chronically mild levels of inflammation and 
oxidative stress may have limited the scope of this study .


Protection against microbial invasion is provided by the 
intestinal barrier  The intestinal barrier has multiple 
lines of defense including commensal bacteria, which com-
petitively inhibit the colonization of pathogenic bacteria and 
the production of metabolically protective compounds such 
as butyrate  Impaired intestinal barrier function may 
result in a local or systemic immune response, mast cell 
degranulation, neuroinflammation and afferent vagus nerve 
activation  In addition, commensal bacterial species 
such as Lactobacillus plantarum regulate intestinal epithelial 
integrity by stimulation of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) in the 
gut epithelium  In one study, extensive transcriptome 
analysis following consumption of three probiotic strains, 
Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. casei, and L. rhamnosus, by 
healthy volunteers showed that each species induced differ-
ential gene expression in networks involved in regulation of 
major basal pathways in the small intestinal mucosa, which 
resembled those induced by specific bioactive molecules and 
drugs  The potential of probiotic bacteria to improve 
intestinal barrier function is discussed extensively in a recent 
review .

Therapeutic alteration of intestinal microbiota in condi-
tions such as IBS may be achieved by ingestion of probiotics 
and prebiotics to increase the number of commensal bac-
teria within the gut, antibiotics which deplete pathogenic 
bacteria, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) which 
introduces a healthy, diverse microbiota into the gut  A 
meta-analysis of FMT reported that the method was highly 
effective for treating recurrent Clostridium difficile infec-
tion and an expert consensus panel has recommended 
indications, technical procedures and clinical trial details 
of FMT for treating various conditions  The panel also 
considered that, at the present time, FMT should be per-
formed only in research settings for treatment of IBD, IBS 
and metabolic syndrome  Further research is needed to 
establish the role of FMT for treating these disorders..

Genetic analysis of the human gut microbiota is com-
monly performed by high-throughput metagenomic sequenc-
ing  and  taxonomic  profiling  following  analysis  of  16S 
ribosomal RNA gene sequences  Full metagenomic 
sequencing of isolates enables not only taxonomic profil-
ing, but also can gain insight at the strain level, and into 
functional parameters such as metabolic pathways and other 
biological processes, virulence factors, and antibiotic resist-
ance. However, there is still a limited understanding of indi-
vidual factors that shape the microbiota on individual level.
It is known that the overall diversity of the human gut 
microbiota changes throughout life, increasing steadily from 
birth until around 12 years of age, remaining relatively stable 
throughout adulthood, and then declining in later years  
In adults, 60–70% of the gut microbiome is stable, with the 
degree of stability varying between phyla  Infections, 
lifestyle and dietary changes cause microbiome instability, 
producing major perturbations of the gut microbiome as 
nicely shown in a high-resolution longitudinal study in two 
individuals  To study the role of the gut microbiome in 
health and disease, the scientific world first must address the 
question: what is a “healthy” microbiome and which factors 
influence the gut microbiome composition. For addressing 
this question and defining the intrinsic and extrinsic factors 
that influence the gut microbiome, Zhernakova et al analyzed 
the LifeLines Deep cohort utilizing metagenomic shotgun 
sequencing of the gut microbiome of 1135 participants and 
more than 200 phenotypic features. This study highlighted a 
relationship between the microbiome and multiple extrinsic 
and host factors, comprising 60 dietary factors, 31 intrinsic 
factors, 19 drug categories, 12 diseases, and 4 smoking cat-
egories. Together, these factors accounted for 18.7% of the 
observed inter-individual variation in the gut microbiome 
with diet being a major modulator of gut microbiome vari-
ation .

Analysis of the gut microbiome revealed that the use of 
proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) was associated with a signifi-
cant decrease in gut microbiota diversity and with signifi-
cant changes of around 20% of bacterial taxa. This adverse 
effect of PPIs on bacterial diversity was greater than for any 
other drug class, including antibiotics. PPIs depleted ben-
eficial bacteria such as the Ruminococcaceae family and 
Bifidobacterium, and increased potentially harmful bacte-
ria including Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus 
genera and Escherichia coli. Results suggested that PPIs 
diminished the gastric acid barrier, as species found in the 
oral microbiome of PPI users were more abundant in the gut 
than in non-users  It is increasingly observed that the 
use of PPIs is associated with an increase in the incidence of 
enteric infections like Clostridium difficile and Campylobac-
ter. Given the profound effect of PPIs on the gut microbiome 
and the fact that over 11% of population in The Netherlands 
and other European countries are using PPIs on prescription 
(not including over the counter use of PPIs) implies a major 
PPI-dependent influence on the gut microbiome taxonomy 
and function on a populational scale..

The human gut microbiota contains bacteria that are ben-
eficial to the host, and bacteria with pathogenic potential, 
termed ‘pathobionts’  An important role of beneficial 
bacteria is the metabolic production of SCFAs by cross-feed-
ing . Fiber-degrading bacteria include Ruminococcus 
callidus, Ruminococcus albus, Blautia obeum and Prevo-
tella spp. which produce solubilized oligosaccharides and 
polysaccharides that act as substrates for butyrate-producing 
species such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Eubacterium 
rectale, Roseburia spp, Eubacterium hallii and Anaerostipes 
spp  Butyrate has multiple effects on the host including 
maintenance of gut barrier function by stimulating the pro-
duction of mucin, antimicrobial peptides, and tight-junction .

Faecalibacterium prausnitzii is a Gram-negative obligate 
anaerobe which is difficult to culture, and taxonomically is in 
the Clostridia order of Firmicutes . It is present in the 
gut of all healthy humans and may act as a biomarker of a 
healthy gut  Dysbiosis associated with CD is character-
ized by reduced abundance of F. prausnitzii  with dysbi-
otic ileal CD patients having a significantly lower abundance 
of F. prausnitzii and a concomitantly increased abundance of 
E. coli  Mechanistically, animal experiments provide an 
explanation for the increased abundance of E. coli in IBD as .

nitrate, which was generated as a byproduct of the inflamma-
tory host response, selectively enhanced growth of E. coli in 
the large intestine of mice  Moreover, F. prausnitzii pro-
duces a 15 kDa anti-inflammatory protein that inhibits the 
NF-κB pathway in intestinal epithelial cells and was shown 
to prevent colitis in a mouse model .

F. prausnitzii uses riboflavin (vitamin B2) as a media-
tor for extracellular electron transfer, as demonstrated in a 
microbial fuel cell system  A Human oxygen-Bacteria 
anaerobic (HoxBan) co-culture system has been developed 
in which F. prausnitzii was cultured with adherent Caco-2 
cells. Caco-2 cells promoted the growth and metabolism of 
the anaerobic F. prausnitzii, while genes involved in inflam-
mation and oxidative stress in Caco-2 cells were suppressed 
by F. prausnitzii .

Anti-oxidants  including  riboflavin  and  vitamin  C  are 
being investigated as new targets for intervention for the 
treatment of dysbiosis. A first pilot open-label study with 
100 mg/day riboflavin showed indeed an increase in fae-
calibacteria and a reduction in E. coli in most participants 
 The double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled 
Ribogut  trial  is  currently  examining  the  effect  of  50  or 
100 mg/day riboflavin administered to healthy volunteers 
for 14 days on the gut microbiota composition with results 
to be expected in 2018..

Preterm infants show delayed colonization of the gut 
microbiota with Bifidobacterium, and have a high preva-
lence of Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus, and Enterococ-
caceae  Vaginally delivered neonates have an increased 
prevalence of maternal microbiota derived from the vagina 
and intestine (e.g. Lactobacillus, Prevotella and Sneathia) 
compared with neonates delivered by Caesarean section. 
Caesarean section delivered infants have a relatively high 
prevalence of skin bacteria such as Staphylococcus, Propi-
onibacterium and Corynebacterium compared to the ones 
that are vaginally delivered  Maternal antibiotic 
treatment that results in reduced utilization of human milk 
and prolonged hospitalization normally causes an increased 
prevalence of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Enterobacteriaceae 
(E. coli and Klebsiella spp.), Staphylococcus, Propionibac-
terium and Corynebacterium  Feeding formula milk 
is associated with increased bacterial diversity, increased 
prevalence of Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium difficile, and 
E. coli, and a decreased prevalence of bifidobacteria .

It has also been suggested that changes in the maternal 
microbiota during pregnancy are important for fetal health, 
since it has been shown that maternal microbiota can be 
transferred to the fetus  The transfer of microbiota from 
the mother to the fetus can be observed in the meconium, 
which in contrast to the earlier beliefs is not sterile  The 
microbiota of meconium has low diversity represented by 
the Firmicutes (Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, and Bacilli), 
Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria phyla, and low bacterial 
cell numbers  Variation in the microbiota of meconium 
is affected by maternal diabetes status and maternal 
gestational diet, with a high-fat diet producing pronounced 
changes in neonatal meconium which persisted in infant 
faces for up to 6 weeks of age .

Direct evidence of transfer of maternal bacteria is derived 
from experiments in mice, in which oral administration of a 
genetically-labelled Enterococcus fecium strain to pregnant 
mice, resulted in a subsequent detection in meconium  
Furthermore, experiments of microbial colonization of preg-
nant germfree mice demonstrated that maternal microbiota 
affects neonatal immune responses. Gestational coloniza-
tion had effects on the innate intestinal immune response of 
the offspring, with increased numbers of intestinal innate 
lymphoid cells (ILC3), macrophages and dendritic cells, in 
addition to an effect on intestinal gene expression including 
genes involved in pathways for sugar metabolism, epithelial 
cell division and proliferation, and mononuclear cell func-
tion .

It has become clear that the fetus and placenta are not 
sterile and the transfer of bacteria occurs from mother to the 
fetus during pregnancy. Therefore, the maternal microbiome 
also seems to be important for the development of the neo-
natal microbiome. This implies that pre- or probiotics use 
may open a possibility to modulate the maternal microbi-
ome during pregnancy, to optimize the development of the 
fetal microbiome. Further studies on the role of the maternal 
microbiome in development of the neonatal microbiome are 
necessary..

Preclinical studies have shown effects of the gut micro-
biota on nociceptive reflexes  feeding, emotional and 
social behavior  and brain neu-
rochemistry  The gut microbiota is essential for 
normal social development in the mouse and is implicated 
in neurodevelopmental disorders including autism spectrum 
disorder  Germfree mice have an exaggerated 
stress response compared with control animals. These mice 
also exhibit increased motor activity and lower anxiety-like 
behavior compared with control mice  Administra-
tion of the probiotic L. rhamnosus (JB-1) to mice reduced .

A  growing  number  of  placebo-controlled  RCTs  have 
investigated the effect of probiotics on mood, cognition 
and brain function in humans. In healthy women, inges-
tion of a fermented milk product supplemented with pro-
biotics containing Bifidobacterium animalis, subsp. lactis, 
Streptococcus thermophiles, and two Lactobacillus spp. 
produced significant changes in brain activity assessed by 
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in response 
to an emotional faces attention task. Reduced fMRI reactiv-
ity was found in interceptive and somatosensory regions of 
the brain which control central processing of emotion and 
sensation  Probiotics containing Lactobacillus helveti-
cus and Bifidobacterium longum showed beneficial psycho-
logical effects in healthy human volunteers, with significant 
improvements in several global tests including the reduction 
of global psychological symptoms, depression and anxiety 
 A probiotic milk drink containing Lactobacillus casei 
Shirota ingested by healthy volunteers had no effect on the 
mood of the group overall, but improved mood in subjects 
with low baseline mood, although an unexpected finding 
was somewhat impaired performance on two memory recall 
tests  Consumption of a multispecies probiotic con-
taining two Bifidobacterium spp and five Lactobacillus spp. .


A link between the gut and brain function is supported by 
additional human studies involving diseased or normal sub-
jects. Many alcohol-dependent subjects have alterations in 
their intestinal permeability and gut microbiome. Increased 
intestinal permeability in these subjects was significantly 
associated with higher scores of depression, anxiety, and 
alcohol craving following 3 weeks of abstinence  A 
placebo-controlled RCT of patients with major depressive 
disorder showed that a probiotic containing two Lactobacil-
lus spp. plus Bifidobacterium bifidum produced a significant 
decrease in Beck Depression Inventory total scores, sig-
nificant decreases in serum insulin levels and serum high-
sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) concentrations in 
addition to a significant increase in plasma total glutathione 
concentrations  A RCT of patients with Alzheimer’s 
disease found that ingestion of a probiotic containing three 
Lactobacillus spp. plus Bifidobacterium bifidum signifi-
cantly improved the mini-mental state examination scores, 
and produced significant changes in a range of metabolic 
parameters including plasma malondialdehyde, serum hs-
CRP and serum triglycerides  Consumption of the 
prebiotic B-GOS, but not the prebiotic FOS, by healthy vol-
unteers significantly reduced the salivary cortisol awakening 
response when compared to placebo
