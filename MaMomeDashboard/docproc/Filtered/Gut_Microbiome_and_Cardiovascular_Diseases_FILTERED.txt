Several studies have been conducted to elucidate which gut bacterial species are involved in the
incidence and progression of CVD (Table 2)  We were the ﬁrst to report that the incidence
of CAD was linked to an alteration of the gut microbial composition  We have reported a
lower abundance of the phylum Bacteroidetes and a higher abundance of the order Lactobacillales
in patients with CAD compared to non-CAD patients with coronary risk factors, such as diabetes,
hypertension, or dyslipidemia, and healthy volunteers using terminal restriction fragment length
polymorphism analysis, which is one of the most well-established and reliable 16S rRNA-based
methods. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, an indicator of dysbiosis, increased in the CAD patients
compared with the non-CAD controls. Interestingly, our data revealed that the CAD patients were
signiﬁcantly more likely to be categorized as enterotype III, which is characterized by low levels
of Bacteroides, compared with the non-CAD controls. Last year, a metagenome-wide association
study of fecal samples from 218 CAD patients and 187 healthy subjects from China was reported 
The abundance of Enterobacteriaceae was signiﬁcantly higher in the CAD patients compared to the
healthy subjects. The abundance of Streptococcus spp. was also signiﬁcantly higher in the patients
with CAD than in the healthy subjects. This may be due to the use of proton pump inhibitors in
CAD patients  Consistent with our results, Bacteroides spp. were signiﬁcantly depleted in the
CAD patients. Given that Bacteroides spp. are known to have an important role in maintaining a
healthy gut ecosystem  and that the abundance of Bacteroides spp. was found to decrease in
patients with atherosclerotic ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack  Bacteroides spp. may
have the potential to regulate atherosclerosis progression. Furthermore, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii,
which exhibits anti-inﬂammatory effects  was also signiﬁcantly depleted in the CAD patients.
Of note, the co-abundance network structure differed between the two groups. The negative.

correlations between Streptococcus spp. and Bacteroides spp. were observed only in the CAD patients.
On the other hand, the positive correlation between Bacteroides spp. and Erysipelotrichaceae bacterium
was seen only in the healthy subjects. These results implied that a peculiar inter-species relationship in
the gut microbiome may exist in CAD patients compared to healthy subjects..

Additionally, there are some studies that have demonstrated the relationship between the
gut microbiome and heart failure (HF). Kamo et al., ﬁrst reported the gut microbial difference in
Japanese heart failure patients  They performed a 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis of fecal
samples from 12 HF patients and 12 age-matched healthy subjects. They further compared the gut
microbiome in HF patients according to age; the gut microbiome in the 12 HF patients younger than
60 years of age were compared with those of the 10 HF patients 60 years of age or older. Although
the richness and diversity of the gut microbiota were not signiﬁcantly different between the HF
patients and healthy subjects, Dorea and Clostridium were less abundant in the HF patients than
in the healthy subjects. Moreover, older HF patients had a lower abundance of Bacteroidetes and
a higher abundance of Proteobacteria compared to the younger HF patients. There is also a report
from China that shows a metagenomic analysis of fecal samples from patients with chronic HF 
They enrolled 53 HF patients and 41 controls with risk factors and compared the compositions of
their gut microbiomes. Ruminococcus, Acinetobacter, and Veillonella increased in the HF patients,
whereas Alistipes, Faecalibacterium, and Oscillibacter decreased.
In line with the previous report,
Faecalibacterium prausnitzii decreased in the HF patients compared to the controls. The results of
these studies suggest that an altered gut microbiome may have an impact on the development and
progression of heart failure. This evidence paves the way for further studies investigating the gut
microbiome in the prevention and management of CVD..
