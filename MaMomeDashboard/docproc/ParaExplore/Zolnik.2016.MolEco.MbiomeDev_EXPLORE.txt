that Studies symbiotic investigate relationships
between internal microorganisms and I. scapularis have
focused on commonly studied human pathogens. For
example, infection of blacklegged ticks by A. phagocy-
tophilum (the causative agent of granulocytic anaplas-
mosis in humans) has been shown to induce protein
expression that increases cold tolerance and, depend-
ing on weather patterns, may aid in tick survival
(Neelakanta et al. 2010). Furthermore,
infection with
B. burgdorferi has been shown to affect questing beha-
viour and movement of
this tick, possibly affecting
survival and/or pathogen transmission (Lefcort &
Durden 1996). However, little is known regarding the
range of microbes the tick comes in contact with or
maintains throughout
its entire life cycle. This tick
experiences a 2-year life cycle, feeding once per life
stage (larva, nymph, and adult) on vertebrate blood.
These bloodmeals are necessary for
the immature
stages (larva, nymph) to moult to the next stage and
for adult females to lay eggs (Needham & Teel 1991;
there are numerous opportunities
Fish 1993). Thus,
for this tick to acquire microbes either during any of
its three bloodmeals or possibly from the environ-
ment, as it spends 98% of its life cycle off-host in a
forested setting (Needham & Teel 1991; Fish 1993).

16S rRNA PCR ampliﬁcation PCR was conducted for the hypervariable regions V3
and V4 of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene using primers
Bakt_341F and Bakt_805R,
following Illumina’s 16S
Metagenomic Sequencing Library Preparation protocol
(Illumina) and a review by Klindworth et al. (2013).
This primer set, resulting in a 450- to 550-bp PCR pro-
duct, was determined to be the best candidate among
512 sets tested in terms of domain and phylum cover-
age for use in 16S rRNA bacterial sequencing (Klind-
worth et al. 2013).
Illumina adaptor sequences were
attached as tails to the PCR primers. The PCRs were
performed in triplicate with 25 lL Phusion High-Fide-
lity PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc), 2.5 lL
(ﬁnal concentration of 0.5 mM) for both primers, 15 lL
nuclease-free PCR-grade water and 5 lL of DNA 4966 C . P . Z O L N I K E T A L .

PCR products was performed using Illumina’s Nex-

sequenced on the same Illumina MiSeq reagent car-
tridge and ﬂow cell. Prior to indexing, a supplemen-
tary quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed to
determine the optimal number of cycles for the index-
ing reaction. A subset of
the PCR products for all
sample pools and the one negative were indexed
using 25 lL KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR Master Mix
(Kapa Biosystems), 10 lL sdH2O, 5 lL Nextera XT
Index 1 Primer, 5 lL Nextera XT Index 2 Primer and
5 lL puriﬁed PCR product. This subset was run on
an ABI 7300 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosys-
tems, Inc.) with an initial denaturation of 95 °C for
3 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s and
55 °C for 30 s, and a plate read after each cycle. The
optimal cycle number for each sample was deter-
mined based on the number of cycles needed for the
qPCR ampliﬁcation curve to begin to peak.

Samples were indexed using 25 lL KAPA HiFi HotS-
tart Ready Mix (Kapa Biosystems), 10 lL sdH2O, 5 lL
Nextera XT Index 1 Primer, 5 lL Nextera XT Index 2
Primer and 5 lL puriﬁed PCR product as suggested by
Illumina. The thermal cycling conditions for the index-
ing PCR consisted of an initial denaturation at 95 °C for
3 min, followed by the optimal number of cycles (8) of
98 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 30 s on a
Techne Prime Elite Thermal Cycler. Indexed amplicons
were puriﬁed with Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beck-

The indexed and puriﬁed amplicons were quantiﬁed
using a High Sensitivity dsDNA Assay on a QUBIT 2.0
Fluorometer (Life Technologies) with 3 lL of gDNA.
The size integrity of the amplicons was validated on a

the signiﬁcance and effect After analysing the taxonomic summaries for all sam-
ple pools, the genus Rickettsia was found to be the most
abundant. To gauge the identity and potential diversity
of Rickettsia species and strains in blacklegged ticks, we
carried out a phylogeny-informed assessment. First, we
isolated 4 315 478 sequences matching the genus Rick-
ettsia using the ‘ﬁlter_fasta.py’ script in QIIME and col-
lapsed them into 91 519 unique sequences using FASTX-
(Gordon 2011). We aligned those unique
TOOLKIT
sequences to an alignment of 241 full-length, reference
16S rRNA Rickettsia sequences retrieved from GenBank,
while accounting for their phylogenetic relationships.
This was achieved by aligning the 241 reference
sequences in MAFFT (Katoh & Standley 2013) with
default parameters
closely related nucleotide
sequences. Then, a maximum-likelihood (ML) phyloge-
netic tree was estimated in RAXML v8.2.8 (Stamatakis
2014) using the general time-reversible nucleotide sub-
stitution model and among-site rate heterogeneity mod-
elled by the Γ distribution and four discrete rate
categories (Yang 1994). The ﬁnal alignment employed
the reference alignment and tree along with the shorter for © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd M I C R O B I O M E O F B L A C K L E G G E D T I C K S 4967 sequences and was carried out in PAPARA v2.5 (Berger &
Stamatakis 2011). The reference ML tree and the large
alignment of 91 760 sequences were used to place the
shorter sequences onto internal, that is internode, or
external, that is terminal, branches on the reference ML
tree. This was carried out using the evolutionary place-
ment analysis (EPA) procedure in RAXML. In an effort to
reach a good trade-off between speed and accuracy, we
restricted the number of candidate branches for place-
ment to 10% of the total 479 branches using a heuristic.
The phylogenetic placements were visualized on the

Results A total of 21 samples – three pools for each of the ﬁve
life stage categories (lab-reared larvae, ﬁeld-collected
larvae, ﬁeld-collected nymphs, ﬁeld-collected adult
females, and ﬁeld-collected adult males), and three
pools for female salivary glands and female midguts –
generated 10 896 297 raw reads on one Illumina MiSeq
ﬂow cell. A total of 6 908 532 sequences passed ﬁlter
and were assigned taxonomy. This resulted in 116 941–
452 654 (mean = 328 977, SD = 96 960) high-quality,
merged sequences per sample (Table S1, Supporting
information). The negative control resulted in <0.001%
(n = 606) of all sequences and was excluded from fur-
ther analysis. The conditional uncovered probability of
the samples, on average,
indicated a high likelihood
that over 99.9% of the bacterial taxa in the samples was
covered. Rarefaction curves from a depth of 1000 to
100 000 sequences indicated sufﬁcient sequencing cov-
erage, as demonstrated by observed OTU accumulation
curves reaching a plateau (Fig. S2, Supporting informa-
tion).

Proteobacteria represented the phylum with the high-

At the genus level, Rickettsia had the highest relative
abundance (55–99.5%) across all developmental stage
samples. In all, 13 genera (and one family-level taxon)
were present with a relative abundance of 1% or greater
in at least one sample (Fig. 2). The relative abundance
of non-Rickettsia taxa increased along developmental
stages (i.e. larvae to nymphs to adults) with the excep-
tion of adult females, which displayed the highest rela-
tive abundance of Rickettsia of all ﬁeld-collected life
stages (Fig. 2). Freshly hatched larvae also had a high
relative abundance of Rickettsia (Fig. 2). Seven taxa were
found in all female and all freshly hatched larvae sam-
ples (matching to the genera Rickettsia, Phyllobacterium,
Burkholderia, Sphingomonas, Pseudomonas and the families
Comamonadaceae
and Oxalobacteraceae); however,
females harboured more observed OTUs than freshly
hatched larvae (Fig. 1). Adult males had the lowest pro-
portion of Rickettsia (55–83%) and thus had more genera
with a relative abundance of ≥1% of any developmental
stage. Wolbachia was the genus with the second highest relative abundance in males (mean = 8.4%) and was
found in all other life stages, but not in all samples,
with a low relative abundance (<0.1%). All ﬁeld-col-
lected developmental stages contained Sphingomonas,
Methylobacterium, Hymenobacter, Pseudomonas, Rhizobium,
Agrobacterium, Luteibacter, Mycobacterium and Curtobac-
terium. Both Borrelia and Anaplasma were only found in
nymphs and adults.

sequences could not be unambiguously placed on single

lends a certain degree of conﬁdence. Global placement

Our results support previous ﬁndings of Proteobacte-
ria being the most abundant phylum in tick species
(Yuan 2010; Hawlena et al. 2013; Narasimhan et al. 2014;
Rynkiewicz et al. 2015; Van Treuren et al. 2015), with
Rickettsia occurring in the highest proportion in © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd blacklegged ticks (Moreno et al. 2006; Yuan 2010; Haw-
lena et al. 2013; Rynkiewicz et al. 2015; Van Treuren et al.
2015). Rickettsia are obligate, intracellular bacteria associ-
ated with eukaryotes,
including arthropods (Perlman
et al. 2006). Although many Rickettsia species are non-
pathogenic (Ahantarig et al. 2013), a number of them are
including Rickettsia rick-
known tick-borne pathogens,
ettsii, R. conorii, R. sibirica, R. japonica, R. australis and
R. akari (Azad & Beard 1998). The Rickettsia endosym-
biont of I. scapularis, presumed to be nonpathogenic, has
been identiﬁed in this tick in previous studies (Noda
et al. 1997; Benson et al. 2004; Moreno et al. 2006; Gille-
spie et al. 2012; Kurtti et al. 2015) and is believed to be
the only Rickettsia species found in this tick (Gillespie
et al. 2012; Kurtti et al. 2015). Recently, the name Rick-
ettsia buchneri has been proposed for this species (Kurtti
et al. 2015). The vast majority of our sequences were
assigned to the rickettsial clade isolated from Ixodes ticks
using a phylogenetic tree-guided procedure. Although
individual short sequences could not be assigned to sin-
gle tree branches with full conﬁdence, they were mostly
assigned to neighbouring branches within a clade of sis-
ter endosymbionts isolated from the same tick species.
We interpret this as an indication of sufﬁcient evolution-
ary informativeness

sequences at the clade level grosso modo, combined with

(2015) than males communities The increase in the observed number of OTUs from
lab larvae to ﬁeld larvae, nymphs and adult males, as
well as the lower number of observed OTUs in adult
females, is concomitant with the relative abundance of
Rickettsia species throughout the life cycle. As Rickettsia
represented over 99% of the taxa in lab larvae and stea-
dily decreased to an average of 66% in adult males
throughout development, it seems likely that other bac-
teria replace Rickettsia. However, despite similar envi-
ronmental exposure, including the time off-host and the
number and types of host bloodmeals, host-seeking
adult male and female blacklegged ticks exhibited
markedly divergent bacterial communities from one
another. Female ticks harboured more homogeneous
bacterial
(Fig. 2). A less
diverse microbiome in females has also been recently
documented in both the blacklegged tick (Van Treuren
et al. 2015) and the lone star tick, Amblyomma ameri-
canum (Ponnusamy et al. 2014). An earlier study identi-
ﬁed Rickettsia in only half of their I. scapularis nymphs
examined (n = 10) compared to all of the larval samples
(n = 10) and concluded that the decrease in Rickettsia
between the larval and nymphal stages was due to the
possibility that male ticks lose Rickettsia species through
each subsequent moult (Noda et al. 1997). This was sup-
ported by the lack of Rickettsia in the testes of adult
males and its presence in adult female ovaries (Noda
et al. 1997). However, although we found relatively less
Rickettsia in males compared to females, our study indi-
cates that Rickettsia sp. are found in whole I. scapularis
adults of both sexes, a ﬁnding also recently reported
(Van Treuren et al. 2015). If all external abiotic and biotic interactions are the same between sexes of the
adult stage, it is plausible that internal factors such as
hormonal mechanisms leading to sexual maturation
and dimorphism in the adult stage may be driving
these sex-speciﬁc differences in bacterial community
diversity.

Although a recent study by Narasimhan et al. (2014)
explored the microbiome of two different cohorts of lar-
vae hatched and reared in the lab (reared in sterile con-
ditions or so-called ‘normal’ containers), our study is
the ﬁrst to compare lab-hatched to ﬁeld-collected larvae.
The decrease in bacterial a-diversity observed in adult
females was also observed in freshly hatched, lab-raised
larvae. These larvae, having no exposure to the ﬁeld,
presumably contain only bacteria that were transovari-
ally transmitted. The high relative abundance of Rick-
ettsia observed in females (mean = 97.8%) was observed
at an even higher relative abundance in the lab-raised
larvae (99.5%), potentially due to certain bacteria found
in females that are not transferred to their offspring.
Transovarial transmission of Rickettsia has been detected
in a number of tick species (Macaluso et al. 2001, 2002;
Horta et al. 2006; Perlman et al. 2006), including I. scapu-
laris (Narasimhan et al. 2014), which our results sup-
port. It is possible that environmental bacteria present
on the tick’s cuticle persisted into the DNA isolation
procedure, despite sterilization with ethanol. However,
this is unlikely, due to the large differences in Rickettsia
present in lab-raised larvae compared to ﬁeld-collected
larvae. Furthermore, if bacteria did persist on the tick
cuticle following ethanol washes, this would have been
observed across all tick developmental stages, including
adult females, which was manifestly not the case.

Given the overwhelming abundance of Rickettsia
across life stages and organs, we attempted to dissect
its subgeneric diversity using phylogenetic criteria and
found the vast majority of the sequences to cluster
with bona ﬁde Ixodes tick rickettsial endosymbionts. It
remains unknown whether this is indicative of a geno-
mewide pattern of conservation due to a bottleneck or
a massive selective sweep accompanying symbiosis, or
a mere localized snapshot of sequence conservation at
this locus. I. scapularis is known so far to harbour one
endosymbiotic rickettsial species (Gillespie et al. 2012;
Kurtti et al. 2015), but ﬁner taxonomic resolution using
more informative genetic markers at
the subgeneric
and strain levels may provide additional insight into
population-level variation and adaptation to intracellu-
lar
life in coexistence with pathogens. Our study
focused on an area with one of the highest pathogen
prevalence levels in blacklegged ticks. Future studies
examining the functional interplay between tick micro-
biomes and pathogens over a larger geographic region
are warranted.
