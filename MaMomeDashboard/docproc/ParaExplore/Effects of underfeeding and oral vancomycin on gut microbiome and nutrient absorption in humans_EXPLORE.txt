children15,16. In adults, a 7-d course of oral antibiotics failed to elicit 
any significant differences in stool calorie loss despite widespread 
changes  in  gut  microbial  community  structure  and  function17. 
These  negative  results  are  surprising  given  the  extensive  data  in 
animal  models,  wherein  microbiota  depletion  with  antibiotics  or 
housing under sterile (germ-free) conditions results in marked dif-
ferences in metabolic phenotypes of adult animals6–8.

Taken together, the causal evidence from multiple animal model 
studies  and  largely  correlative  or  retrospective  data  from  human 
cohorts  led  us  to  further  investigate  the  role  of  the  human  gut 
microbiome  in  nutrient  absorption.  We  designed  a  clinical  study 
(ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02037295) to test whether inter-
ventions  designed  to  alter  the  gut  microbiota  cause  significant 
differences  in  stool  calorie  loss,  which  serve  as  an  experimentally 
quantifiable proxy for nutrient absorption. In this two-phase study, 
we directly measured stool and ingested calories along with plasma 
biomarkers  of  host  and  microbial  metabolism  during  overfeeding 
(OF) and UF (phase I) and then in a randomized, double-blind, pla-
cebo-controlled trial with oral vancomycin versus placebo (phase II). 
Previous studies have indicated that oral vancomycin can decrease 
the relative abundance of the Firmicutes phylum while preserving 
Lactobacillaceae18 which has been associated with beneficial meta-
bolic  effects19.  Oral  vancomycin  also  has  minimal  absorption  and 
thus nearly no local or systemic side effects in healthy individuals20.

Results
UF  and  antibiotics  both  impair  nutrient  absorption.  We  con-
ducted a controlled dietary study in two contiguous phases (Fig. 1). 
Individuals were admitted to the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) for 
approximately 31 d (Fig. 1), during which they were fed a weight-
maintaining diet (WMD) (20% kcal protein; 30% kcal fat; 50% kcal 
carbohydrate) adjusted to maintain a stable weight (±1%). In total, 
we screened 51 potential participants, of which 27 initiated and 25 
completed the study (Extended Data Fig. 1). In phase I, participants  were fed 3 d each of 150% of WMD (OF diet) and 50% of WMD 
(UF diet) with a 3-d washout period in between in random order in 
a cross-over design. In phase II, the same subjects were randomized 
to placebo or oral vancomycin. There were no significant differences 
in the vancomycin versus placebo groups in sex, age, body weight, 
body mass index (BMI), percentage body fat or glucose homeostasis 
(Supplementary Table 1). Participants were inpatients for the entire 
study  and  were  monitored  daily,  and  there  were  no  reported  side 
effects, in particular diarrhea or abdominal symptoms.

Our  results  from  phase  I  demonstrated  that  caloric  intake 
led  to  significant  differences  in  nutrient  absorption.  As  speci-
fied  by  our  study  design,  daily  ingested  calories  were  signifi-
cantly  higher  during  OF  (4,446.5 ± 547.8 kcal d−1)  relative  to  UF 
(1,494.2 ± 211.0 kcal d−1;  Fig.  2a).  On  average,  this  corresponds  to 
a difference of 2,952.3 kcal d−1. Food and stool calories were mea-
sured  by  bomb  calorimetry,  allowing  us  to  calculate  percentage 
calorie  loss  for  each  individual  (100 × (stool  calories/ingested  cal-
ories)).  As  expected,  the  absolute  number  of  calories  lost  per  day 
was significantly higher in overfed relative to underfed individuals 
(257.4 ± 91.2 kcal d−1 versus 123.5 ± 32.4 kcal d−1, Δ = 139.4 kcal d−1, 
P < 0.0001, paired Student’s t-test; Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 
2).  However,  when  expressed  as  percentage  of  ingested  calories 
per  day,  there  was  significantly  greater  stool  calorie  loss  during 
UF relative to OF (8.9 ± 3.7% versus 5.8 ± 1.9%, Δ = 2.3% per day, 
P < 0.0001, paired Student’s t-test; Fig. 2c and Supplementary Table 
2), with a strong and significant intrasubject correlation (Pearson’s 
r = 0.70,  P = 0.004).  Transit  time  was  faster  during  UF  compared 
with  OF  (Δ = −10.6 h,  P = 0.0035,  paired  Student’s  t-test;  Fig.  2d). 
Daily  calorie  loss  from  urine  was  lower  during  UF  versus  OF  in 
absolute  values  (Supplementary  Table  2)  but  was  higher  during 
UF  versus  OF  when  expressed  as  percentage  of  ingested  calories 
(Extended Data Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 2). There was no 
detectable  effect  of  diet  order  or  sex  (all  P > 0.07;  Supplementary 
Table 3).

Next,  we  sought  to  compare  these  results  in  a  parallel  study 
design aimed at directly targeting the gut microbiota. As specified by 
our study design, daily ingested calories were comparable between 
the  placebo  and  vancomycin  groups  (Fig.  3a  and  Supplementary 
Table  2). Vancomycin  led to a significant  increase in  stool calorie 
loss expressed in absolute kilocalories per day (260.1 ± 66.5 kcal d−1 
versus  176.8 ± 79.5 kcal d−1,  Δ = 83.2 kcal d−1,  P = 0.012,  unpaired 
Student’s  t-test;  Fig.  3b)  or  the  percentage  of  ingested  calories 
(8.4 ± 1.9% versus 5.8 ± 2.2%, Δ = 2.6, P = 0.0069, unpaired Student’s 
t-test; Fig. 3c). Importantly, transit time did not differ between van-
comycin and placebo groups (P = 0.2, unpaired Student’s t-test; Fig. 
3d).  In  contrast  to  the  dietary  intervention,  there  was  no  differ-
ence  in  urine  caloric  excretion  between  the  vancomycin  and  pla-
cebo groups (Extended Data Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 2). 
No  differences  were  observed  when  the  analysis  was  stratified  by 
sex (Supplementary Table 4). There was also no absolute change in 
trajectory for body weight in individuals treated with vancomycin 
(Δ = 0.2 kg, P = 0.5, unpaired Student’s t-test). Taken together, these 
results support our hypothesis that both UF and vancomycin result 
in greater stool calorie loss relative to ingested calories (greater per-
centage  of  calories  measured  in  stool),  indicating  a  reduction  in 
nutrient absorption in both states.

Shifts  in  the  gut  microbiome  in  response  to  UF  and  oral  anti-
biotics.  To  identify  candidate  effector  microorganisms  that  could 
contribute  to  the  observed  differences  in  nutrient  absorption,  we 
evaluated  the  impacts  of  dietary  and  pharmacological  perturba-
tions  on  gut  microbial  community  structure  using  a  combination 
of amplicon and metagenomic sequencing. We sequenced samples  from all 25 participants at key time points during phase I, includ-
ing a baseline sample collected at the beginning of the trial, mid-
point samples collected during each 3-d UF and OF period, samples 
collected pre and post each dietary intervention and three samples 
collected  during  the  vancomycin  or  placebo  arm  (Supplementary 
Table 5). To examine longitudinal changes in gut microbial struc-
ture throughout the study, we also sequenced daily samples during 
phase I (16 d) for ten subjects, including five subjects who showed 
the highest difference in percentage stool calories loss and another 
five subjects who showed the lowest difference in percentage stool 
calories loss between the dietary arms (Supplementary Table 5).

Our nutritional results from phase I (Fig. 2) led us to speculate 
that the gut microbiota may be relatively ‘starved’ of nutrients dur-
ing the UF phase, which would be expected to lead to a decrease in 
bacterial colonization. Surprisingly, we found a significant increase 
in total colonization levels (Fig. 4a) during UF versus OF. These dif-
ferences were still significant after normalizing for stool production 
(P = 0.005,  paired  Wilcoxon  test).  Overall  microbial  community 
structure  was  maintained  throughout  the  3-d  UF  and  OF  inter-
ventions, maintaining the significant interindividual differences at 
baseline (Fig. 4b–d). When analyzed within each subject, we were 
able to identify two individuals (of ten evaluated) that had signifi-
cant differences in overall microbial community structure between 
diet arms (Fig. 4e), which may suggest that the baseline gut micro-
biota matters for its sensitivity to the dietary interventions. Overall 
microbial diversity was also relatively stable throughout the 16 d of 
phase I (Fig. 4f); however, there was significant increase in diver-
sity on the final day of UF relative to the final day of OF (P = 0.04, 
paired  Wilcoxon  test).  There  were  no  significant  differences   NATURE MEDiciNE | www.nature.com/naturemedicine ArticlesNature MediciNeP = 0.5 ∆ = 83.2 kcal d–1

in  phylum-  or  genus-level  relative  abundance  between  diet  arms, 
with the exception of the Verrucomicrobia phylum which was sig-
nificantly  increased  during  UF  (Extended  Data  Fig.  3).  At  a  finer 
taxonomic level, we were able to identify four 16S ribosomal RNA 
sequence  variants  that  were  significantly  associated  with  the  diet 
arm (independent of order): A. muciniphila, Bacteroides coprocola, 
a  Lachnospiraceae  sp.  and  a  Ruminoccoccus  sp.  (Fig.  4g).  Taken 
together,  these  results  indicate  the  overall  resiliency  of  the  gut 
microbiota faced with differences in caloric intake while also high-
lighting  a  small  number  of  diet-responsive  bacterial  species  that 
could contribute to the observed differences in nutrient absorption.
Next, we used metagenomic sequencing to confirm and extend 
the  observed  shifts  in  gut  bacterial  relative  abundance.  Samples 
were  selected  from  18  individuals  at  four  key  time  points  includ-
ing a baseline  sample,  midpoint samples  during  each 3-d UF and 
OF period, a sample during the washout period in between and a 
sample during the vancomycin or placebo arm. In total, we gener-
ated 381.7 giga base pairs of sequencing data from the 95 samples 
during  phase  I  (Supplementary  Table  6).  Differentially  abundant 
bacteria  on  each  diet  arm  (independent  of  order)  were  identified 
using  a  paired  Wilcoxon  test.  This  analysis  revealed  nine  bacte-
rial  species  that  were  significantly  different  between  the  two  diet 
arms (Fig. 4h and Supplementary Table 7), including an enrichment 
for A. muciniphila during UF, consistent with our 16S rRNA gene 
sequencing-based  analysis  (Fig.  4g).  We  also  detected  an  enrich-
ment for multiple Alistipes species during UF.

In contrast to caloric intake, the oral antibiotic vancomycin had 
dramatic and reproducible impacts on the gut microbiota relative to 
placebo controls. While colonization level was not different by treat-
ment group (P = 0.26, unpaired Wilcoxon test; Fig. 5a), there was a 
significant decrease in microbial diversity, as assessed by 16S rRNA 
gene  sequencing  (P < 0.0001,  unpaired  Wilcoxon  test;  Fig.  5b).  Vancomycin  also  had  a  significant  impact  on  gut  microbial  com-
munity structure, outweighing the pre-existing interindividual dif-
ferences (Fig. 5c). Compared with placebo, the vancomycin-treated 
subjects  had  marked  changes  in  phylum-level  relative  abundance 
(Extended  Data  Fig.  4a).  Finer-level  analysis  of  sequence  variants 
demonstrated  several  discrete  clusters  of  bacteria  across  different 
phyla that were altered in the vancomycin-treated group (Extended 
Data Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 8).

Metagenomic sequencing confirmed the broad and reproducible 
differences between the vancomycin and placebo groups. Analysis 
using unpaired Wilcoxon tests revealed 41 bacterial species with a 
significant difference (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05) in relative 
abundance  (Fig.  5d),  with  a  skew  towards  decreased  abundance 
in the vancomycin group (31 decreased, 10 increased). Consistent 
with  our  16S  rRNA  gene  sequencing  data,  these  vancomycin-
depleted  bacteria  spanned  multiple  gram-positive  (Actinobacteria 
and  Firmicutes)  and  gram-negative  (Bacteroidetes)  phyla.  Three 
Veillonella  species21  were  significantly  enriched  in  vancomycin-
treated  individuals.  We  also  detected  an  enrichment  for  multiple 
Lactobacillus  and  Klebsiella  species  in  the  vancomycin  group,  in 
addition  to  a  virulent  bacteriophage  that  infects  lactobacilli  (Lc-
Nu)22,  consistent  with  evidence  in  mouse  models  that  antibiotics 
induce phage production23.

Despite increased stool calorie loss with both UF versus OF and 
vancomycin  versus  placebo,  we  found  markedly  different  effects  of 
these interventions on the gut microbiota. UF and OF produced little 
perturbation at the phylum or finer levels, while vancomycin resulted 
in widespread changes in gut microbial community structure. Despite 
these differences, we were able to identify two bacterial species that 
consistently changed in response to both perturbations (Fig. 5e) based 
on  16S  rRNA  sequence  variants  analysis:  A.  muciniphila,  a  mucin-
degrading  bacterium  with  a  putative  role  in  preserving  gut  barrier  NATURE MEDiciNE | www.nature.com/naturemedicine ArticlesNature MediciNefunction24–26,  which  was  enriched  during  UF  and  in  the  vancomy-
cin group, and an unidentified species belonging to Lachnospiraceae 
NK4A136 group, which decreased during UF and vancomycin inter-
ventions. Metagenomic sequencing confirmed the enrichment for A. 
muciniphila  during  UF  (Fig.  4h),  and  a  trend  towards  increased  A. 
muciniphila abundance in the vancomycin group (P = 0.25).

Mechanistic insights into host–microbiome interactions relevant 
to  metabolic  disease  in  UF  versus  OF  and  vancomycin  versus 
placebo  interventions.  To  gain  further  insight  into  the  specific 
bacterial  genes,  enzymes  and  metabolic  pathways  associated  with 
nutrient absorption, we annotated our metagenomic datasets using 
HUMAnN2 (ref.  27). Consistent with our taxonomic analyses (Fig. 
4), which revealed modest perturbation of gut microbial commu-
nity structure with UF versus OF, functional profiling of the micro-
biome  datasets  did  not  reveal  any  significant  differences  in  gene 
family  or  metabolic  pathway  abundance  between  the  diet  arms. 
In  contrast,  we  found  significant  differences  in  the  abundance  of 
760 of a total of 3,553 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 
(KEGG)  functional  orthologs  (KEGG  Orthology)  (FDR < 0.1, 
Supplementary  Table  9)  between  vancomycin  and  placebo,  con-
sistent  with  the  widespread  changes  in  gut  microbial  community 
structure (Fig. 5a–d). At the pathway level there was a more modest 
difference between groups; only 3 of 290 metabolic pathways were 
differentially abundant (all decreased) with vancomycin compared 
with placebo (Extended Data Fig. 5). Interestingly, two of the three 
significant  pathways  (pyruvate  fermentation  to  butanoate  and  the 
superpathway of Clostridium acetobutylicum acidogenic fermenta-
tion) were related to the fermentation of sugars to the major short-
chain  fatty  acid  butyrate  (aka  butanoate),  suggesting  that  there 
could  be  reduced  butyrate  production  or  bacterial  metabolism  by 
the gut microbiota during vancomycin treatment.

To  provide  more  direct  support  for  the  inferred  differences  in 
gut  microbial  metabolism,  we  evaluated  plasma  short-chain  fatty 
acids as markers of the ability of the gut microbiome to process and 
metabolize nutrients, together with hormones and bile acids impli-
cated in nutrient absorption and gut barrier function. These mea-
surements were performed before and following each intervention. 
Consistent  with  earlier  studies28–33,  GLP-1  and  leptin  significantly 
increased during OF and leptin and GLP-2 significantly decreased 
during UF (Supplementary Table 10). Butyrate, a major end-prod-
uct of gut bacterial metabolism, was significantly decreased follow-
ing  both  UF  (Fig.  6a)  and  vancomycin  (Fig.  6b),  supporting  our 
metagenomic analyses and consistent with a decrease in the capac-
ity of the gut microbiome to harvest nutrients during these inter-
ventions. Deoxycholic acid, a secondary bile acid, also significantly 
decreased following both interventions (Fig. 6c,d). Elevated deoxy-
cholic  acid  has  been  implicated  in  increased  gut  permeability34. 
Lower concentrations may imply preservation of the gut barrier and 
lower nutrient absorption. Vancomycin also decreased acetate, pro-
pionate and the secondary bile acid lithocholic acid (Extended Data  Fig. 6), consistent with the broad impact of this oral antibiotic on 
the gut microbiome.

Increased stool calorie loss might be due to improved gut bar-
rier  function,  thereby  decreasing  gut  permeability.  We  measured 
two  circulating  plasma  markers  that  when  increased  may  signify 
increased  gut  permeability:  zonulin,  a  modulator  of  intercellular 
tight junctions35; and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a product of gram-
negative  bacteria36.  There  were  no  changes  in  plasma  zonulin  or 
LPS concentrations with UF (Supplementary Table 10). During OF, 
plasma  zonulin  concentration  increased  (Δ = 0.4,  P = 0.04,  paired 
Student’s  t-test)  but  there  was  no  change  in  plasma  LPS  concen-
trations.  Plasma  LPS  and  zonulin  concentrations  did  not  change 
during  vancomycin  or  placebo  administration.  Except  for  a  slight 
increase in zonulin with OF, we did not find evidence of altered gut 
permeability. Lastly, we evaluated whether vancomycin administra-
tion affected energy or substrate oxidation rates or metabolites that 
regulate fat storage and glucose metabolism. There were no signifi-
cant differences in (1) angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) or lipopro-
tein lipase activity (LPL) (Supplementary Table 11); (2) 24-h energy 
expenditure  or  substrate  oxidation  (Extended  Data  Fig.  7);  or  (3) 
glucose tolerance or insulin concentrations (Extended Data Fig. 8).

Discussion
In  this  two-phase  study  we  directly  measured  ingested  and  stool 
calories, demonstrating an increased and comparable stool calorie 
loss relative to ingested calories during two states: UF versus OF and 
oral vancomycin versus placebo. This increase in stool calorie loss 
during UF and vancomycin administration occurred despite differ-
ent effects on the gut microbiota. We saw a modest perturbation of 
gut microbial community structure with UF versus OF, while oral 
vancomycin  induced  widespread  changes  with  reduced  diversity 
and marked shifts in gut bacterial relative abundances. Decreased 
plasma butyrate and deoxycholic acid concentrations were common 
to  both  interventions  that  induced  greater  stool  calorie  loss.  Our 
study  employs  direct  measurements  of  ingested,  stool  and  urine 
calories and close monitoring of and consistency of dietary intake, 
through the critical periods of stool collection. As participants were 
inpatients, provided stool samples were timed so that we were able 
to analyze gut bacterial abundance concurrent with interventions.

As a major end-product of bacterial metabolism, plasma butyr-
ate  is  a  marker  of  the  availability  or  ability  of  the  gut  microbiota 
to  process  nutrients37.  Given  this,  our  results  indicate  that  either 
decreased calorie delivery to the microbiome, as in the case of UF, 
or widespread changes in its structure, due to oral vancomycin, limit 
microbiome nutrient harvesting capacity, resulting in increased stool 
calorie loss. This offers evidence based on directly measured calories, 
in  the  form  of  stool  calorie  measurement  accounting  for  ingested 
calories, that in humans the gut microbiome has a measurable role 
in metabolizing nutrients. Based on our results, we would estimate 
that the gut microbiome harvested an additional ~2.5% of absolute 
ingested calories under the conditions used for our study cohort.

nutrient  absorption.  Our  current  study  differs  by  more  carefully 
controlling OF and UF by systematically providing diets that were 
50%  or  150%  of  participants’  weight-maintaining  needs.  We  con-
firmed and quantified the effect of UF on increasing relative stool 
calorie loss. However, in contrast to our previous results, we did not 
observe significant changes at the phylum level. The difference in  our  current  study  may  have  been  due  to  the  more  carefully  con-
trolled dietary conditions, with each participant receiving the exact 
same foods for each 3-d OF and UF period, indicating that factors 
other than calorie load (for example, differing meal content) may 
have led to our previously observed changes in phylum-level bacte-
rial relative abundance.

Our results also differ from another carefully conducted study17 
that  did  not  find  an  effect  of  oral  vancomycin  on  stool  calories 
despite widespread changes in gut microbial community structure 
and  metabolite  concentrations.  We  carefully  controlled  ingested 
calories,  with  both  placebo  and  vancomycin  groups  receiving  the 
exact same meals. By measuring ingested calories, we were able to 
calculate percentage of stool calories absorbed. This is important, 
as  labeled  calories  reflect  ‘metabolizable’  calories  whose  accuracy 
is problematic for careful energy balance studies such as these38–41. 
Nevertheless,  we  found  differences  in  both  absolute  and  percent-
age  stool  calories.  The  difference  in  actual  calories  of  ~80 kcal d−1 
appears to be comparable to the difference in stool calories between 
placebo and vancomycin groups in the study by Reijnders et al.17.

Our  results  provide  insights  into  potential  mechanisms  that 
could explain the increased stool calories loss. Both perturbations 
(UF and vancomycin) resulted in a significant increase in the rela-
tive abundance of A. muciniphila, which is recognized for its ability 
to forage on host mucins42. In mice, A. muciniphila counteracts the 
effect of the decrease in mucous layer thickness produced by a high-
fat diet26, producing weight loss without changes in food intake. A. 
muciniphila increases turnover of the mucous layer preventing dis-
ruption of tight junctions, which may reduce gut permeability43,44. 
In  humans,  a  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  pilot 
study revealed a trend towards decreased body weight and fat mass  in  response  to  A.  muciniphila  supplementation45.  Administration 
of  pasteurized  A.  muciniphila  cells45  in  this  study  increased  stool 
energy content, consistent with our results. Additional studies are 
warranted to elucidate the role and mechanisms of A. muciniphila 
in nutrient absorption.

Both perturbations led to a significant decrease in plasma butyrate 
and deoxycholic acid concentrations, consistent with earlier studies17. 
These  two  compounds  play  opposing  roles  in  the  gastrointestinal 
tract,  affecting  gut  barrier  function  and  modifying  epithelial  layer 
nutrient  permeability.  In  vitro,  deoxycholic  acid  reduces  both  the 
tight junction protein zonula occludens-1 and mucin-producing gob-
let cells and increases intestinal macrophage polarization, suggesting 
that deoxycholic acid interferes with intestinal barrier function and 
induces  intestinal  inflammation34.  Butyrate,  on  the  other  hand,  has 
a salutary effect on gut barrier function46. In vitro studies show that 
butyrate and other short-chain fatty acids stimulate intestinal barrier 
formation, inducing protection against disruption from LPSs47. Our 
observations suggest that caloric intake and antibiotics may disrupt 
the balance between these, and likely other, microbial metabolites that 
regulate barrier function, resulting in altered nutrient absorption.

We  evaluated  alternative  mechanisms  that  could  explain  the 
observed  differences  in  nutrient  absorption.  We  did  not  find  evi-
dence  that  circulating  markers  of  gut  permeability  (plasma  LPS36 
and zonulin35,48,49) decreased with interventions that led to reduced  NATURE MEDiciNE | www.nature.com/naturemedicine ArticlesNature MediciNenutrient  absorption.  Energy  content  in  stool  may  also  be  affected 
by  colonic  transit  time,  which  was  more  rapid  with  UF.  In  rats,  a 
reduced  transit  time  increases  fecal  volume  and  suppresses  fat 
absorption50.  During  isocaloric  diets  of  similar  macronutrient  but 
differing fiber content, high-fiber (expected to increase stool calorie 
loss) decreases transit time compared with low-fiber diets51. For UF, 
more rapid transit could have decreased contact time with gut epi-
thelium, decreasing absorption.

We  do  acknowledge  several  limitations.  Our  sample  size  was 
small, yet in this carefully controlled inpatient study we had a diverse 
participant population. The study was powered to detect differences 
in stool calorie excretion between UF and OF and vancomycin ver-
sus placebo. Thus, we lacked power to detect associations between 
the gut microbiota and stool calorie loss. Also, we acknowledge that 
a direct causal role for the bacterial species, genes and metabolites 
associated with energy harvest needs to be tested in animal models 
and controlled human intervention studies.

The  functional  role  of  the  human  gut  microbiome  in  nutrient 
absorption remains a topic of intense interest in the field of energy 
balance. In our study, both calorie restriction and oral vancomycin 
led to increased stool calorie loss and lower levels of plasma butyr-
ate. The magnitude of this effect is ~2.5% of ingested calories, which 
would translate to a ~1.2-kg weight loss in a 100-kg subject over 1 yr 
(ref. 52). By limiting nutrient availability to the microbiome by calo-
rie restriction or altering the ability of the microbiome to metabo-
lize calories by widespread change in community structure, our data 
provide evidence for a causal role for the human gut microbiome in 
nutrient metabolism.
