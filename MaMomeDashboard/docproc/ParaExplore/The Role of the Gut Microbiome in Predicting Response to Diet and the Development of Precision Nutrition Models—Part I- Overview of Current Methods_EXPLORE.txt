Current Status of Knowledge Methods for conducting precision nutrition studies
Aspects of study design, dietary intervention methods, and
response criteria are discussed below and are summarized for
recent studies in Table 1.

Intervention studies allow researchers to standardize
the dietary stimulus, providing every participant the same
amount (or relative amount) and type or quality of ingredi-
ents. Interventions involving humans or animals supplement
participants’ habitual diets or completely standardize diets by
providing all meals during the intervention period. Although
standardizing participants’ diets reduces variability,
it is
both expensive and intensive, and requires a much greater Figure 1 Numerous research ﬁelds are integrated and contribute
to our overall understanding and study of personalized health and
nutrition.

using an arcsine square root transformation (92), which
is the transformation used by MaAsLin (multivariate as-
sociation with linear models) (93), a bioinformatics tool
used by researchers to discover associations between clinical
variables and the microbiome. For a more comprehensive review of such tools, please refer to Mallick et al. (94).
Log transformation is another commonly used method,
but as it cannot be applied to zeros, this method also
requires that zeros be replaced with small values (i.e. pseu-
docounts). The choice of pseudocount can influence results Gut microbiome and precision nutrition: Part I 15 Zmora et al. (2018) (63) Microbiota composition and function (16S, qPCR,

methods of conducting the study and preparing the gut
microbiome data. Where they differ, is in the statistical
analysis of these data and the use of models to predict
response and validate associations found in the first step
of precision nutrition-microbiome research. It is important
to note that these goals (association and prediction) are
not mutually exclusive and several methods may be utilized
within the same study to address different scientific goals
and analyze different parts of the data set. The complexity of
the task of analyzing the microbiome and its various effects
means that this is often the case. Each of these methods
has its own advantages and limitations, which should be
recognized when presenting or comparing the results of
studies.

Comparing 2 groups in association studies.
The t-test compares the mean responses of 2 groups to
determine whether they are significantly different. This
would be appropriate when comparing the abundance of
a single taxa between 2 groups at 1 time point. The t-test
may be conducted on paired data (e.g. comparing means
within the same individuals at different time points as in a
cross-over design) or unpaired data (e.g. comparing means
between unrelated individuals as in a parallel design). This
approach assumes that the data are normally distributed
(parametric) or the sample size is “large.” The t-test does
not account for potential confounding factors. The Mann–
Whitney U (also called the Wilcoxon rank-sum) test is
a nonparametric (does not assume the data are normally
distributed) alternative to the t-test. When the spread
and shape of the 2 distributions are the same, the Mann–
Whitney U test compares the median of 2 unpaired samples
(e.g. between groups). The Wilcoxon signed-rank test is used
to determine if the median of the differences between paired
responses is different from zero (e.g. within individuals). For
example, comparing the abundance of a single taxa within
1 individual before and after a dietary intervention. When
the dependent variable is categorical (e.g. abundance above
or below the median), a G-test or chi-square (or Fisher’s
exact test) test may be used when the data are unpaired or
a McNemar’s test may be used if the data are paired. Both Levels of microbiome classification.
There are many different levels at which the microbiome may
be analyzed, from broad classifications such as enterotypes
to targeted species identification. This complexity leads to
many different ways in which responsive groups may be
differentiated.

Arumugam et al. (95) first introduced the concept of
“enterotypes”, clustering individuals into 3 groups according
to their dominant genera: Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Ru-
minococcus. Although enterotypes have since been shown
to exist more on a continuous scale (96), the Bacteroides
and Prevotella enterotypes have been consistently replicated
across cohorts (97). The identification of the Ruminococcus
enterotype is more dependent on clustering and modeling
approaches (97). Studies, such as Hjorth et al. (18, 45), Roager
et al. (19), Kovatcheva-Datchary et al. (21), Gu et al. (72),
and Chen et al. (9), highlight measures such as enterotype or
the Prevotella to Bacteroides ratio. Diversity and richness are
also common measures used to highlight differences between
groups (12, 13, 21–24, 39, 40, 42, 44, 48, 62, 64, 65).

Comparing >2 groups in association studies.
When the number of comparison groups exceeds 2, methods
such as ANOVA, permutational multivariate analysis of vari-
ance (PERMANOVA), analysis of similarities (ANOSIM),
or Kruskal–Wallis may be used. ANOVA analyzes the
differences between group means and can examine the effects
of multiple (categorical) independent variables on a single
(univariate) or multiple (multivariate) dependent variables
(i.e. 2-way, 3-way). This is useful when comparing multiple time points or when the number of groups exceeds 2, as
in Bouhnik et al. (28), which tested 7 different types of
nondigestible carbohydrates to determine their effect on
the gut microbiota. Kruskal–Wallis is the nonparametric
equivalent of the 1-way ANOVA and has been used to
develop tools such as linear discriminant analysis effect size
(LEfSe) (99). PERMANOVA is a nonparametric alternative
to multivariate ANOVA (MANOVA) (100, 101). ANOSIM is
also used to compare multiple independent variables with a
multivariate dependent variable (101). It differs from PER-
MANOVA in that, instead of using the raw data, ANOSIM
ranks values based on their similarity/dissimilarity. This
minimizes the effects of outliers in the data, making it useful TABLE 4 Statistical methods1 Independent variable Categorical = 2 Categorical >2 Continuous Continuous AND categorical Dependent variable Categorical G-test Chi-square test

multivariate ANOVA methods use Euclidean distance, both
PERMANOVA and ANOSIM may be implemented with any
distance/dissimilarity metric.

Both animal and in vitro models have limitations when
it comes to drawing conclusions about human health and
nutrition as they lack the specific interactions present in
the human supraorganism. For further information, readers
are directed to additional reviews of animal (136, 137) and
in vitro (138–140) models for human nutrition research.
However, these techniques used in combination with human
clinical trials will be crucial in the development of precision
nutrition research and our understanding of the interaction
between the host and the gut microbiota.
