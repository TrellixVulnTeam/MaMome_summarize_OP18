['Kaliannan et al. Microbiome           (2018) 6:205 \n\nPage 2 of 22\n\nincreasing body of evidence suggests that estrogens\nalso have important beneficial effects on body fat and\nmetabolism in males [10, 11].\n\nThe gut microbiota comprises trillions of bacteria that\ncontribute to nutrient acquisition and energy regulation\n[12, 13]. Growing evidence indicates that obesity is\nclosely linked with low-grade chronic inflammation\n(LGCI), which can lead to MS [14, 15]. In addition,\nchanges in the composition of the gut microbiota are\nknown to be associated with the development of obesity\nand its associated metabolic disorders [16]. Interestingly,\nan increased ratio of the major phyla Firmicutes and\nBacteroidetes (FIR/BAC ratio) and depletion of several\nbacterial species (e.g., Akkermansia mucinophilia) can\npromote the development of obesity in both dietary and\ngenetic models of obesity in mice [17–19]. Other studies\nin animal models of obesity suggest that obesity-induced\ngut dysbiosis caused by either environmental or genetic\nfactors increase populations of bacteria that produce the\nendotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [14] and decrease\nLPS-suppressing bacteria [20, 21]. This process leads to\nimpaired gut barrier integrity and release of LPS from\nintestinal gram-negative bacteria into the bloodstream\n[14, 22] which in turn leads to Toll-like receptor 4\n(TLR4)-mediated metabolic endotoxemia (ME), LGCI and\ninsulin resistance in obese mice [23, 24]. Moreover,\nchronic injection of LPS in mice causes mild obesity and\ninsulin resistance [23], highlighting a possible role for\nmicrobiota-derived LPS in obesity-induced inflammation.\nThe causative role of the gut microbiota in the context\nof MS is well characterized [14, 20, 21], but the role of\nsexual\ngut\nmicrobiota in the context of MS, and the associated\nmechanisms underlying such differences, are still un-\nclear. Here, we report that sexual dimorphism in MS is\nassociated with estrogen-mediated changes in the gut\nmicrobiome, ME and LGCI, and that 17β-estradiol\n(17β-E)\ntreatment prevents MS in male and\novariectomized (OVX) mice by altering gut microbiome\nand intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP), a major gut\nmicrobiota-modifying enzyme. Our results shed light on\ndistinct male and female profiles for gut microbiome,\nIAP, and markers of ME and LGCI that may contribute\nto sexual dimorphism in MS, revealing new possibilities\nfor preventing and controlling human obesity-related\nmetabolic dysfunction in males and postmenopausal\nwomen.\n\ndimorphism on the\n\ncomposition of\n\n(E2)\n\nResults\nSex differences in ME and LGCI are associated with sexual\ndimorphism in MS\nWe found that relative to males (n = 11), female mice (n =\n11) had significantly lower levels of markers of WD-induced\nobesity, including gross appearance of mice, intra-abdominal\n\nand gonadal fat distribution, body weight gain, and white\nadipose tissues accumulation) (Additional\nfile 1: Figure\nS1a-c). Noticeably, although there were no differences in\nenergy intake between males and females (Additional file 1:\nFigure S1d), relative to males, females had improved MS pa-\nrameters such as glucose intolerance (glucose tolerance test\nwith area under the curve and HOMA-IR) (Additional file 1:\nFigure S1e), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (Additional file 1:\nFigure S1F-I), and dyslipidemia (total serum cholesterol,\ntriglyceride, HDL-C, LDL-C, and atherogenic index) (Add-\nitional file 1: Figure S1j-n). We then investigated whether\noral 17β-E (E2) administration ameliorated WD-induced\nMS in male and ovariectomized (OVX) mice (n = 5 per\ngroup). Interestingly, MS parameters were more evident in\nOVX mice compared to normal female (F) mice, and the\nadministration of 17β-E significantly suppressed the devel-\nopment of MS in the male (male+E2) and OVX (OVX+E2)\ngroups (Fig 1a–o and Additional\nfile 1: Figure S1y-z),\nirrespective of energy intake (Additional file 1: Figure S1x).\nNotably, there were no significant differences in MS param-\neters between the female and male+E2 groups (Fig. 1a–o\nand Additional file 1: Figure S1y-z). This was accompanied\nwith elevated levels of serum 17β-E concentrations in male\n+E2 and OVX+E2 groups treated with 17β-E compared to\ncontrol male and OVX groups respectively (Additional file 1:\nFigure S1p). We investigated whether sexual dimorphism in\nMS is associated with sex-specific differences in the markers\nof ME [serum LPS, LPS-binding protein (LBP), soluble\nCD14 (sCD14), and intestinal permeability] and LGCI\n[tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α),\ninterleukin-1β (IL-1β),\nIL-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and\nIL-10], and whether estrogen plays a key role in this context.\nSurprisingly, we found significant differences in the markers\nof ME (Fig. 1q–t and Additional file 1: Figure S1o-r) and\nLGCI (Fig. 1u–y and Additional file 1: Figure S1s-w) be-\ntween WD-fed male and female mice. Lack of endogenous\nestrogen support in the OVX mice induced significantly ele-\nvated levels of markers of ME (Fig. 1q–t) and LGCI\n(Fig. 1u–y) compared to the female group. Moreover, 17β-E\ntreatment reduced the occurrence of ME and LGCI in the\nM+E2 and OVX+E2 groups to levels equal to those female\nmice (Fig. 1q–r).\n\nGut microbiome mediates the development of metabolic\nsyndrome in a sex-specific manner\nGiven that metabolic endotoxemia is commonly derived\nfrom gut dysbiosis, we next used high-throughput 16S\nrRNA gene sequencing to determine whether sexual di-\nmorphism exist in gut microbiome, and whether 17β-E\ntreatment affected the microbiome composition. V3-V4\n16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed on fecal sam-\nples collected from M, F, M+E2, OVX, and OVX+E2\ngroups (n = 5 per group) that were fed a WD.

Male (M), normal female (F), and ovariectomized (OVX) female mice were divided in to five groups (M,\nF, M + E2, OVX, and OVX+E2; n = 5/group) and were fed western diet (WD) ± 17β-estradiol (E2) in the drinking water for 6 weeks. a β-diversity analysis\nof whole microbiota relative abundance (RA) using principal coordinate analysis (PCOA) with Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index (BCD) followed by\npermutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) significance test. b Similarity percentage (SIMPER) analysis with BCD was used to identify\nthe specific genera with the greatest contribution to the differences observed between the groups, followed by principal component analysis (PCA)\n(variance-covariance type) showing the top 10 operational taxonomic unit (OTU) scores included as vectors.

One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s\nmultiple comparisons test\n\nShigella largely contributed to M/OVX groups, whereas\nLPS-suppressing Akkermansia muciniphila [14, 25] and Bifi-\ndobacterium [14, 26] were associated with the female and\n\n17β-E-treated M/OVX groups (Fig. 2b). At the phylum level,\nthe majority of the bacterial phyla identified in the fecal\nsamples were encompassed by Bacteriodetes, Firmicutes,\n\n\x0cKaliannan et al. Microbiome           (2018) 6:205 \n\nPage 5 of 22\n\nin accordance with the SIMPER test,\n\nProteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia, as shown in Fig. 2c.\nFurthermore, the relative abundance (RA) of taxa, which\nshowed false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected P value < 0.05\nwith differential expression analysis conducted on whole\nmicrobiota profile, were expressed as heat map (Fig. 2d and\nAdditional file 1: Table S2), including hierarchical clustering\n(HCN). HCN is a clustering technique for graphically sum-\nmarizing the inter-sample relationships in the form of a\ndendrogram. HCN also clearly separated the male/OVX\nsamples as a single cluster from the other three groups (F,\nM+E2, OVX+E2) (Additional file 1: Figure S2a). In order to\nfurther identify microbial taxa that serve as biomarkers for\ndifferent groups, we performed liner discriminate analysis\n(LDA) coupled with effect size measurements (LEfSe). A\ncladogram (Fig. 2e) generated from LEfSe analysis showed\nthe relationship between taxon and biomarker taxa (LDA\nscore > 2 and a significance of P < 0.05 determined by the\nWilcoxon signed-rank test) (Additional file 1: Figure S2b).\nNotably,\nthe\nLPS-producing phylum Proteobacteria and its members\n(class_γ-Proteobacteria, family_Enterobacteriacea and gen-\nus_Escherichia/Shigella) were higher in the OVX group\n(Additional file 1: Figure S2b). We also demonstrated that a\nnumber of well-studied microbiota-based markers of obes-\nity and MS associated with LGCI were affected by estrogen.\nThese included the phylum Proteobacteria [14]; Firmicutes\nto Bacteroidetes ratio (FIR/BAC ratio—a known marker of\nobesity [14, 17]; Bifidobacterium/Enterobacteriaceae ratio\n(B/E)—a well-established marker of colonization resistance\nto opportunistic pathogens [27]; and the genus Akkerman-\nsia, which has been shown to reduce fat mass gain and\nWAT macrophage infiltration and improve gut barrier\nfunction and glucose metabolism [28]. Sexual dimorphism\nwas clearly identified with respect to all four markers, with\nsignificantly lower Proteobacteria abundance, decreased\nFIR/BAC ratios, higher B/E ratios, and increased Akker-\nmansia abundance in normal females compared to normal\nmale and OVX females (Fig. 2f–i). 17β-E treatment signifi-\ncantly reduced Proteobacteria and elevated Akkermansia in\nthe male (M+E2) (Fig. 2f, i) and significantly reduced the\nProteobacteria and increased the B/E ratio in OVX fe-\nmales (OVX+E2) (Fig. 2f, h). In addition, resulting taxa\nidentified with pairwise comparison analyses at different\ntaxonomic levels are summarized in the Additional file 1:\nTable S3. Next, we employed PICRUSt to predict the\nmetagenomes and determine the changes in microbial\nmetabolic pathways (KEGG) across different groups [29].\nMale/OVX groups were segregated from the other three\ngroups using PCoA applied on predicted functional path-\nways (Additional file 1: Figure S2c). According to LEfSe\nanalysis, LPS-related functional pathways were signifi-\ncantly lower in the female, M+E2 and OVX+E2 groups\ncompared to male and OVX groups (Additional file 1: Fig-\nure S2d-f). The α-diversity profile for groups reached\n\nstable values as indicated by the observed plateaus seen\nfor each group in the Rarefaction curves (Additional file 1:\nFigure S3a-e). Together, these results highlight the sex\nspecific shifts in gut microbiome that occurred upon WD\nand 17β-E treatment.\n\ncocktail\n\nWe next used fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)\nand antibiotic (ABX)-induced depletion to investigate\nwhether gut microbiota were necessary to mediate sex-\nual dimorphism in MS. FMT with fecal content from\ndonor male mice fed WD for 10 weeks was performed\non female 10-week-old recipient mice pretreated with an\n[19]. Unexpectedly, male mice\nantibiotic\nfecal-transplant induced obesity (Fig. 3a–c) and glucose\nintolerance (Fig. 3d and Additional file 1: Figure S3f )\nand elevated serum TG (Fig. 3e), and markers of ME\n(Fig. 3f–h) and LGCI (Fig. 3i) in female recipients, with\nno differences between male and M → F groups (n = 5\nper group). Moreover, fecal β-diversity microbiota ana-\nlysis (Fig. 3j) and HCN with heat-map analysis (Fig. 3k)\nshowed that the M and M → F samples were clustered\ntogether and were separated from the female control\ngroup (n = 3 per group). M and M → F groups presented\nwith higher Proteobacteria and Firmicutes and lower\nVerrucomicrobia and Bacteroidetes compared to females\n(Fig. 3l). LEfSe showed γ-Proteobacteria and Enterobac-\nteriacea for M and M → F groups analyzed as a single\ncluster (Fig. 3m and Additional\nfile 1: Figure S3g).\nHigher RA of both Proteobacteria and FIR/BAC ratios,\nand lower B/E ratio and Akkermansia muciniphila abun-\ndance (Additional file 1: Figure S2g-j) were also observed\nwith the M → F group, while there were no significant\ndifferences in the α-diversity measures (Additional file 1:\nFigure S3h-l). Principal component analysis (PCA) with\npredicted metabolic pathways clustered the M and M →\nF groups (Additional file 1: Figure S2k), and significantly\nhigher abundance of LPS-related functions were found\nwith LEfSe analysis (Additional file 1: Figure S2l). Finally,\nall of the abovementioned results were associated with\nundetectable (< 6.6 pg/mL) serum E2 levels in the M →\nF(Additional file 1: Figure S3m) group after FMT.\n\nTo further explore the causative role of gut micro-\nbiota, we next depleted the gut microbiota [14] in mice\nusing a well-established ABX cocktail. Male and female\nmice (n = 5/group) were fed WD for 10 weeks to induce\nMS. As expected, we found appreciable sexual dimorph-\nism in the markers of ME (Fig. 4a), LGCI (Fig. 4b and\nAdditional\nfile 1: Figure S4a), and MS (Fig. 4c and\nAdditional file 1: Figure S4b-d). Mice then received the\nABX cocktail in drinking water for next 6 weeks. Strik-\ningly, in addition to elimination of sexual dimorphism in\nmarkers of ME (Fig. 4a–d), LGCI\n(Fig. 4e–h and\nAdditional file 1: Figure S4a), and MS (Fig. 4i–n and\nAdditional file 1: Figure S4b-d), female mice showed\nsignificantly elevated levels of gut permeability (Fig. 4d),\n\n\x0cKaliannan et al.

Interest-\ningly, female mice showed significantly lower serum E2\nlevels after ABX treatment compared to before ABX\n\ntreatment (Additional file 1: Figure S4e). In combination,\nthe results of these FMT and ABX experiments suggest\nthat the gut microbiome mediates sexual dimorphism in\nthe MS mainly through regulating the development ME\nand LGCI.\n\n\x0cKaliannan et al.

Then, a broad-spectrum antibiotic cocktail (ABX) containing\nampicillin (1 g/L), vancomycin (500 mg/L), neomycin sulfate (1 g/L) (added to drinking water), and metronidazole (100 mg/kg) (orally gavaged\nevery 12 h) was administered for next 6 weeks to deplete the gut microbiota. a–d Sexual dimorphism in markers of metabolic endotoxemia\n(serum LPS, LBP, sCD14, and intestinal permeability). e–h Markers of low-grade chronic inflammation (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, MCP-1, and IL-10). i–n\nFeatures of metabolic syndrome (body weight, glucose tolerance test, insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), serum triglycerides and HDL-C).

Male mice (n = 10) were fed WD for 4 months to\ninduce severe obesity and MS and then treated with or\nwithout G and D isoflavones for 5 weeks. Interestingly, ISO\n\ntreatment significantly reversed the WD-induced obesity\n(Fig. 5a–c), glucose intolerance and HOMA-IR (Fig. 5d–f),\ndyslipidemia (Fig. 5g–j), and NAFLD (including formation\nof Mallory bodies and mild fibrosis induced by WD)\n(Fig. 5k) despite similar energy intake between the male\n(n = 4) and male+ISO (n = 6) groups (Additional file 1:\nFigure S5a). As expected, the reversal of MS parameters\nwas associated with lower levels of markers of ME (Fig. 5l)\n\n\x0cKaliannan et al.

Student’s t test or repeated measures one-way ANOVA followed by\nTukey’s multiple comparison test\n\nand LGCI\n(Fig. 5m). Furthermore, we found higher\nmRNA levels of estrogen receptor (ER)-α and no changes\nwith ER-β in the duodenal tissues of ISO-treated male\nmice (Additional file 1: Figure S5b-c). Moreover, principal\ncoordinate β-diversity analysis applied on entire fecal\nmicrobiome population distinctly clustered the Male+ISO\nand Male samples on axis one (Fig. 5n). Interestingly, simi-\nlar to 17β-E, SIMPER test showed a higher contribution of\nEscherichia-Shigella to the M group whereas Akkermansia,\nBifidobacterium, and Bacteroides were associated with the\nM+ISO group (Fig. 5o). At the phylum level, ISO treatment\nsignificantly reduced the RA of Proteobacteria and in-\ncreased Actinobacteria and Verrucomicrobia (Fig. 5p). Dif-\nferential expression with HCN analysis also grouped the M\n+ISO samples and the RA of major bacterial groups as\nshown in the heat map (Fig. 5q). In addition, significantly\nlower Proteobacteria levels (Fig. 5r), higher B/E ratios\n(Fig. 5t), increased Akkermansia levels (Fig. 5u), and signifi-\ncantly greater α-diversity measures (Additional file 1: Figure\nS5b-f) were observed in the M+ISO group, although no dif-\nferences were observed with FIR/BAC ratios (Fig. 5s). PCA\nof predicted functional metabolic pathways also segregated\nthe M+ISO group from the male samples (Fig. 5v). In\naddition, the RA of LPS-related functional pathways were\nsignificantly lower in M+ISO group compared to male\ngroup (Fig. 5w, x), which was also confirmed by LEfSe\nanalysis (Fig. 5y). These data suggest that dietary supple-\nmentation of phytoestrogens such as ISO may exert effects\nsimilar to those of 17β-E on the microbiome, ME, and\nLGCI in males to prevent MS.\n\nIntestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) drives sexual\ndimorphism in gut microbiota\nIt has been well established that endogenous antimicro-\nbial peptides (eAMP) (e.g., IAP and Reg3γ) maintain\nnormal gut homeostasis and regulate gut microbiota\ncomposition [14, 30]. Next, we examined the extent to\n\ntissues of\n\nwhich sexual dimorphism in gut microbiome was driven\nby differences in AMP levels between males and females,\nand whether estrogen status affected endogenous eAMP\nproduction. Among the eAMPs analyzed (Fig. 6a, b and\nAdditional file 1: Figure S5i-j), we found significant dif-\nferences only in IAP between groups based on sex and\nestrogen treatment (Fig. 6a, b). Recently, we and others\nhave shown the gut microbiome-modifying effects of in-\ntestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP), especially with re-\nspect to LPS-related and gram-positive bacterial groups\n[14, 31–33]. In addition to in vitro cell culture studies,\nthe study groups (Fig. 2) were\nduodenal\nanalyzed for IAP after 6 weeks of 17β-E treatment. We\nfound upregulated mRNA expression levels of Akp3 (a\nmajor IAP isozyme) (Fig. 6a), downregulated expression\nof the Akp6 IAP isozyme (Fig. 6b), higher villus-associ-\nated enterocytes expression of IAP with immunohisto-\nchemical staining (Fig. 6c), elevated IAP protein levels\n(Fig. 6d), and elevated IAP enzymatic activity in the duo-\ndenum (Fig. 6e) of female and 17β-E-treated male and\nOVX groups compared to normal male and OVX mice.\nMoreover, the stimulation of differentiated Caco2 cells\nwith 17β-E (10 nM) significantly elevated IAP levels in a\ntime-dependent manner (Fig. 6f ). Similarly, elevated\nmRNA expression of Akp3 (Fig. 6g, with no detection of\nexpression of Akp6), higher immunochemical staining of\nIAP (Fig. 6h, i), elevated IAP protein levels (Fig. 6j), and\nelevated IAP activity (Fig. 6k) were observed in the duo-\ndenum of M+ISO group compared to male group after\n5 weeks of ISO treatment. In addition, in vitro stimula-\ntion of Caco2 cells with 25 μM concentration of either\ngenistein (G) or daidzein (D) or G+D combination also\nresulted in increased IAP protein levels (Fig. 6l). We also\nexamined\nusing\nof\nL-phenylalanine (L-phe), a specific non-competitive in-\nhibitor [14, 32, 34, 35] of IAP.

Further\nanalysis using samples collected from in vivo (17β-E and\nISO experiments in mice) and in vitro (Caco-2 cells) ex-\nperiments indicated that both 17β-E and ISO signifi-\ncantly upregulated the mRNA levels of nuclear\ntranscription factor KLF4 (gut-enriched Krüppel-like fac-\ntor) (Additional file 1: Figure S5k-l). There was a clear\ntrend of increased mRNA levels of Cdx1 (caudal-type\nhomeobox-1)\nfile 1:\nFigure S5m-n), both KLF4 and Cdx1 are major tran-\nscription factors that target IAP [36]. To further ver-\nify whether\nfactors\nresponsible for the differences in the gut microbiota\nbetween male and female C57BL/6 mice, we exam-\nined the effects of IAP inhibition on the status of key\nmicrobiota changes. After 8 weeks of WD and L-phe\n(10 mM) treatment, we found that the L-phe-treated female\nmice exhibited a significant increase in LPS-producing Pro-\nteobacteria, decrease of B/E ratio, increase of the relative\nabundance (RA) of Akkermansia muciniphila and no\ndifferences in FIR/BAC ratio (Fig. 6n–q) compared to the\nuntreated female (F) group (n = 5 per group). Accordingly,\nthe L-phe-treated female group showed significantly\nhigher\nlevels of markers of metabolic endotoxemia\n(Fig. 6r–t), LGCI (Fig. 6u), and glucose intolerance (Fig. 6v\nwith no differences in body weight gain (Fig. 6w). These\nresults support the notion that sexual dimorphism in en-\ndogenous IAP activity might partially drive differences in\ngut microbiota between male and female, and 17β-E and\nISO-treated C57BL/6 mice.\n\nNetwork interactions reveal host-microbiome interactions\n(HMI) driven by estrogen status\nIntegrating significant microbial associations detected\nfrom OTU tables with metadata measurements of interest\nusing correlation network analysis not only will provide us\nwith valuable insights into the dynamics of the interac-\ntions between external factors and the microbial commu-\nnity, but also can help us understand how the detected\n\nrelationships might change when additional variables are\ntaken into account [37]. The HMI network (Fig. 7a) was\nfirst built from Spearman’s nonparametric rank correlation\ncoefficient (P < 0.05) between host parameters and micro-\nbial genera. Each node was colored according to the “data\ntype” and sized based on “betweenness centrality,” which\nquantifies the influence of a node in connecting other\nnodes within network values. Edges (lines) represent sta-\ntistically significant correlations, and are colored light\nblack for positive and blue for negative correlations. Next,\nnodes were grouped as modules and the first three largest\nmodules of the network were taken to show the relation-\nship between specific genera and host parameters (Fig. 7b,\nd).

Endogenous estrogens in\nthe female mice, exogenous supplementation of 17β-E\nto male and ovariectomized female mice, and dietary\nsupplementation of ISO to male mice upregulate KLF4\ntranscription factor that target IAP, which, in turn, in-\ncreases the endogenous IAP activity in the gut. Ele-\nvated IAP activity leads to decrease Proteobacteria and\nFIR/BAC, increase B/E, and the abundance of Akker-\nmansia genera, decreasing LPS-producing bacteria\n(e.g., Proteobacteria) while increasing LPS-suppressing\nbacteria (e.g., Bifidobacterium and Akkermansia muci-\nnophila). These changes lower LPS production and IP,\nresulting in reduced ME.

Endogenous estrogens in the female mice, exogenous supplementation of 17β-\nestradiol (17β-E) to male (M+17β-E) and ovariectomized female (OVX+17β-E) mice and dietary supplementation of isoflavones (ISO) to male mice\nupregulate nuclear transcription factors (KLF4) that target IAP, which, in turn, increases the endogenous IAP activity in the gut. Elevated IAP activity\nleads to decreased Proteobacteria and Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio (FIR/BAC), increased Bifidobacterium to Enterobacteriacea ratio (B/E), and the\nabundance of Akkermansia genera, decreasing LPS-producing bacteria (e.g., Proteobacteria) while increasing LPS-suppressing bacteria (e.g., Bifidobacterium\nand Akkermansia mucinophila). These changes lower LPS production (LPS biosynthesis and related proteins) and intestinal permeability, resulting in\nreduced metabolic endotoxemia (serum LPS/LPS binding proteins/soluble CD14). The subsequent reduction of inflammatory cytokines leads to the\nsuppression of low-grade chronic inflammation and metabolic syndrome.

Given the causative role of ME originating from\ndysbiotic gut microbiota and LGCI induced by ME in the\ncontext of WD-induced obesity and MS [14–16], the\nnovel findings in our study are as follows: (1) sex-specific\ndifferences in the gut microbiota composition (e.g., Proteo-\nbacteria, FIR/BAC ratio, B/E ratio, and Akkermansia) and\nfunctions (e.g., LPS biosynthesis and LPS-related proteins)\nand markers of ME and LGCI induced by WD are associ-\nated with sexual dimorphism in MS. (2) Male mice are\nmarkedly susceptible to ME and LGCI and female mice\nare exclusively protected from ME and LGCI. (3) Gut\nmicrobiota, especially LPS-related bacteria, mediate the\nsexual dimorphism in MS, reflected by the fact that male\nmice microbiota transplants induced ME, LGCI, and MS\nin the female recipients and that ABX abolished the sexual\ndimorphism and worsened the MS markers in female\nmice. (4) 17β-E induces gut microbiome changes, which is\nassociated with lower susceptibility to WD-induced ME,\nLGCI, and MS in the male and OVX mice. Moreover,\n17β-E-induced gut microbiome changes and protection\nagainst MS are associated with elevation of activity and\nexpression of IAP. (5) Estrogen-like compounds (e.g., iso-\nflavones) had gut microbiome-modifying effects similar to\nestrogens and prevented WD-induced ME, LGCI, and MS\nin male mice by elevating IAP, indicating that dietary sup-\nplementation of isoflavones could be a potential alterna-\ntive to 17β-E to treat men and postmenopausal women\nwho are affected by obesity and MS. (6) IAP could largely\nmediate the 17β-E and ISO-induced gut microbiome\nchanges, and this might be due to the E2-mediated upreg-\nulation of transcription factors that target IAP such as\nKLF4 and CDX1.\n\nIt is important to note that the major gut micro-\nbiota findings (changes in Proteobacteria, FIR/BAC ra-\nand Akkermansia)\ntio, B/E ratio,\nreported here\nregarding sexual dimorphism have been studied ex-\ntensively in animals and also in the humans in the\ncontext of obesity and MS [17–19]. Data obtained\nfrom animal models identified consistent differences\nin the two major bacterial phyla, with a significant in-\ncrease in Firmicutes and decrease in Bacteroidetes\nlevels\nto\nwild-type mice despite similarities in their diet and\nactivity levels [16]. Consistent with pre-clinical data,\nnumerous human studies have consistently demon-\nstrated that the FIR/BAC ratio is specifically increased\nin obese people [17–19]. Metabolic endotoxemia de-\nrived from gut dysbiosis is central to the pathogenesis\nof chronic low-grade inflammation, a factor underlying\nmany current chronic diseases [9, 22]. Metabolic endotox-\nemia can be determined by the abundance of bacteria\n\nobese mice\n\ngenetically\n\ncompared\n\nin\n\nof\n\nthe\n\nfatty\n\nacids\n\ndevelopment\n\nendotoxemia\n\naffecting LPS production and gut barrier function. It is\ntherefore conceivable that the 17β-E-induced marked re-\nductions in LPS-producing bacteria (e.g., Proteobacteria)\nand increases in LPS-suppressing bacteria (e.g., Bifidobac-\nterium and A. mucinophila) [14, 25–27] significantly sup-\npressed\nand\ninflammation. Recent clinical studies have shown that\nLPS-producing bacteria are abundant in obese subjects\nwith type 2 diabetes [14, 16, 38–40]. It has also been\nshown that male mice fed a WD rich in milk fat and\nof\nomega-6\nof\nLPS-producing\nLPS-suppressing Bifidobacterium spp [27, 41, 42].\nAlong these lines, the WD diet used in the present\nstudy induced a dramatic increase in Proteobacteria and a\ndecrease in Bifidobacterium in male and OVX mice (Fig. 3\nand 5). In this context, decreasing the abundance of LPS-\nproducing bacteria and increasing the LPS-suppressing\nbacteria may be a key mechanism for the reduction of\nmetabolic endotoxemia. Another potential mechanism\ncontributing to the reduction of serum LPS may be a de-\ncrease in gut permeability, due to the observed elevation\nof gut barrier-protecting bacteria such as Bifidobacterium\n[14, 43] by estrogen in our study.\n\novergrowth\nreduction\n\nProteobacteria\n\nexhibit\n\nand\n\nIn postmenopausal women and in female animal\nmodels,\nlower estrogen levels are associated with in-\ncreased visceral adiposity [10] and estrogen replacement\nimproves glucose-insulin homeostasis [44]. We have\nshown here for the first time the effects of E2 replace-\nment on gut microbiota and metabolic endotoxemia in\nOVX mice, which mimics the postmenopausal state.\nThere is growing evidence for a fundamental role of es-\ntrogen in the regulation of obesity and related metabolic\ndisorders in males [11, 45], and recent data from rodent\nstudies suggest that hepatic estrogen signaling has a key\nrole in the prevention of high-fat diet-induced insulin\nresistance in males. However, it is not known whether\nestrogen treatment in males protects MS by modulating\ngut microbiota. Our novel results show that estrogen\ntreatment in males is associated with the modulation of\ngut microbiota and improvement\nin ME and LGCI,\nwhich is associated with improvements in weight man-\nagement and obesity-induced metabolic changes (Fig. 7),\nsupporting the concept that estrogen plays an important\nrole in the control of serum LPS levels by affecting\nLPS-related gut microbiota.\n\nfunctions [46, 47]. It\n\nIAP is an endogenous antimicrobial peptide with nu-\nis highly\nmerous physiological\nexpressed in the small\nintestine, secreted from apical\nenterocytes into the lumen in microvilli vesicles, and\ntravels to the large intestine [48]. IAP is known to inhibit\nthe growth of E. coli and gram-negative bacteria by de-\nphosphorylating LPS located in the outer membrane [32,\n48–51]. IAP is also able to dephosphorylate ATP [33],\n\n\x0cKaliannan et al. Microbiome           (2018) 6:205 \n\nPage 14 of 22\n\nwhich has been shown to reduce the survival of\ngram-positive bacteria (46), and to support the growth\nof gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli [52]. Oral IAP\nsupplementation has also been shown to prevent E. coli\novergrowth [53]. We recently found in our fat-1 mice\nmodel (transgenic mice with elevated tissue n-6/n-3 fatty\nacid ratio) that elevated endogenous IAP activity and ex-\npression is associated with lower levels of LPS-producing\nbacteria and higher levels of LPS-suppressing bacteria\n[14]. Moreover, we found that inhibition of IAP by phenyl-\nalanine, a frequently used specific inhibitor of endogenous\nIAP activity [14, 15, 34, 35], caused ME, LGCI, and MS by\nincreasing the growth of LPS-producing Proteobacteria\nand reducing the growth of LPS-suppressing Bifidobacter-\nium spp in a mouse model of elevated endogenous IAP\nactivity [14, 15]. It is clear that IAP expression in the intes-\ntine is a critical determinant of the gut microbiota profile.\nOur findings indicate that IAP may be a primary factor\npartially mediating the effects of estrogen on gut micro-\nbiota because IAP inhibition in the female mice led to the\ndevelopment of ME, LGCI, and MS, associated with dra-\nmatic increase of Proteobacteria and reduction of the B/E\nratio and A. mucinophila abundance (Fig. 6n–q). The\nmechanism by which estrogen may modulate IAP ex-\npression is possibly due to its regulatory effect on the\nKLF4 transcription factor, which has been shown to\ntarget IAP [36].\n\nIsoflavones (ISO) are non-steroidal compounds that\ncan bind to both ER-α and ER-β due to their ability to\nmimic the conformational structure of estradiol [54,\n55], and thereby imitate the actions of estrogens on\ntarget tissues [56]. Isoflavones are found in many le-\ngumes and are particularly abundant in soy products.\nGenistein (G) and daidzein (D), two major soy isofla-\nvone glucosides, are present at high concentrations in\nsoybeans and soybean-derived products and are a\nsource of xenoestrogen exposure in both\nmajor\nhumans (e.g., soy-based formula for infants, tofu) and\nanimals (most commercially available diets). G and D\nare widely used as dietary supplements in the USA for\nvarious presumed health benefits [57]. Ferguson et al.\n[58] administered a low-dose endotoxin (LPS 1 ng/kg)\nto induce postprandial\nin\nyoung, healthy volunteers and found that subjects with\na\nagainst\ndiet were\ninflammation-induced decline in insulin sensitivity.\nMeals high in fat, or fat and simple carbohydrates, are\nknown to induce metabolic endotoxemia [59], as char-\nacterized by increased circulating markers of inflam-\nmation, and hypothesized to be linked to transient\nbacteremia due to reduced gut barrier function [59].\nMost importantly, ISO has been shown to have E2\nmimetic effects in preventing ovariectomy-induced\nmetabolic dysfunctions [60], adipose deposition [61],\n\nhigh-isoflavone\n\nendotoxemia\n\nprotected\n\ntransient\n\nhypertriglyceridemia, and hepatic status [62] in animal\nstudies. Isoflavones have been shown to improve intes-\ntinal barrier integrity [63] and reduce colitis in animal\nmodels [64] potentially through modulation of the gut\nmicrobiome [65]. ISO may therefore confer protection\nagainst diet-induced metabolic dysfunction and reduce\ninsulin resistance in males and\nthe development of\ntherefore supporting our\npost-menopausal women,\nproposal that ISO could be an effective alternative to\nE2 treatment.\n\nAlthough we claim to explain the metabolic sexual di-\nmorphism by effects of E2 through gut microbiota, we\nacknowledge that many other studies in the field showed\nthat the major impact of estrogens on the metabolism\nare through estrogen receptor expression in metabolic\ntissues [66–69]. Clinical trials revealed that hormone re-\nplacement therapy (HRT) in postmenopausal women re-\nduced the features of MS and inflammation [70].\nConversely, findings from Women’s Health Initiative clin-\nical trials (WHI-CT) [71] did not support use of HRT for\nchronic disease prevention [72]. However, the WHI-CT\nresults were based on a group of women who were much\nolder than those normally treated with HRT and who had\nother numerous risk factors [73]. Noticeably, there were\nvery limited surveys performed addressing the effects on\nthe metabolic syndrome components in postmenopausal\nwomen [74]. Early treatment with low-dosage HRT in\nhealthy perimenopausal women was found to have benefi-\ncial effects on the components of metabolic syndrome and\ncould decrease the risk of cardiovascular events [74] since\nthe absolute risk of CVD events were markedly lower in\nyounger, compared to older, women [71].\n\nAlthough our results from FMT (Fig. 3) and antibiotics\n(Fig. 4) experiments contradict the protective effect of en-\ndogenous estrogen against obesity in female mice, it is\nwell known that antibiotic usage [75] or gut dysbiosis [76]\nimpacts estrogen metabolism mediated by microbiota\nConsequently, changes in circulating levels of estrogen\n(Additional file 1 Figure S3m and Additional file 1:\nFigure S4e) were found in female mice that received\nmale microbiota transplants or antibiotic treatment.\nWe hypothesize that estrogen-mediated gut micro-\nbiome changes may be the cause for sex differences in\nobesity and MS in this study. It is important to note\nthe estrogen-mediated sex differences and the role of\nthe microbiome have been linked in other disease con-\nditions (e.g., autoimmunity) [77]. The bacterial changes\nreported here are similar to previous studies where ovari-\nectomy or estrogen supplementation was performed. A\nstudy with OVX animals showed elevated Firmicutes to\nBacteroidetes ratio [78] and Escherichia coli [79] com-\npared to normal females. Likewise, it was shown that E2\nsupplementation elevated the relative abundance of Akker-\nmansia and Bifidobacterium in the male and OVX mice\n\n\x0cKaliannan et al. Microbiome           (2018) 6:205 \n\nPage 15 of 22\n\nrespectively [80–82]. Estrogen inhibited the overgrowth of\nProteobacteria and E. coli and decreased the levels of LBS\nand LBP under simulated microgravity [83]. In addition,\nE2 supplementation in male [84] or OVX mice [61] pre-\nvented obesity and MS, and genistein prevented obesity\nand metabolic dysfunction in the mice, which was similar\nto E2 supplementation in the same study [60, 61].\n\nConclusions\nOur novel data demonstrate that the gut microbiome\nmediates sexual dimorphism in MS. Overall measures\nof correlation, pairwise correlations, and multivariate\ncorrelation analyses between the microbiota and host pa-\nrameters that we performed provided novel insight into\nthe host–microbiota system in the context of sexual di-\nmorphism in WD-induced MS. Estrogen or estrogen-like\ncompounds induced elevated IAP levels likely by upregu-\nlating the function of the KLF4 transcription factor that\ntargets IAP and subsequent gut microbiome changes\nlower LPS production and gut permeability, resulting in\nreduced ME and systemic LGCI with subsequent reduc-\ntion in the susceptibility to develop WD-induced MS in\nestrogen-treated males and post-menopausal women. Be-\ncause exogenous estrogen administration to male causes\ndeleterious effects (e.g., feminization and cardiac dysfunc-\ntion) [85], compounds with estrogen-like activity (e.g., iso-\nflavones and 17α-estradiol\n[85]) and non-feminizing\neffects may represent an alternative approach to the man-\nagement of obesity and MS in males. Understanding the\nmolecular basis of estrogen-mediated changes in IAP ac-\ntivity and gut microbiome may provide new approaches to\nthe management of obesity-associated metabolic disease\nin men and menopausal women with estrogen deficiency,\na condition that can last approximately 30 years of a\nwoman’s life [86].\n\nMethods\nAnimals and diets\nAll the mice used in this study were wild-type (WT) on\na C57BL/6 background and bred at the Massachusetts\nGeneral Hospital (MGH) animal facility or purchased\nfrom Charles River Laboratories. Mice were housed in\na biosafety level 2 room in hard top cages with two or\nthree mice per cage. Mice were maintained in a\ntemperature-controlled room (22–24 °C) with a 12-h\nlight/12-h dark diurnal cycle and allowed for food and\nwater ad libitum. Diets used in this study were either\nnormal chow diet (CD) (Laboratory Rodent Diet 5001)\nfrom LabDiet or western diet (WD) (D12079B) from\nResearch diets, Inc., NJ, USA. All animal procedures in\nthis study were carried out in accordance with the\nguidelines approved by the MGH Subcommittee on Re-\nsearch Animal Care.\n\nAnimal experiments\nBody weight and food intake were measured every week\nfor all mice. All food was replaced weekly to avoid con-\ntamination. For collection of blood samples, mice were\nfasted for 6 h during the light phase period and blood\nwas taken from the facial vein unless otherwise speci-\nfied. After 6 h fasting, animals used in this study were\neuthanized by i.p. injection of pentobarbital (200 mg/\nkg). Several experiments with special treatments are de-\nscribed below.\n\n1) Determination of sexual dimorphism in metabolic\n\nendotoxemia, low-grade chronic inflammation, and\nmetabolic syndrome: Male (M) WT (n = 11) and\nfemale (F) (n = 11) mice were weaned and switched\nto western diet (WD) until the age of 20 weeks to\ninduce severe WD-induced obesity and MS. Both\ngroups were subjected to analysis of markers of\nmetabolic endotoxemia (ME) (including LPS, LBP,\nsCD14, and intestinal permeability), systemic low-\ngrade chronic inflammation (LGCI) (including\nTNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, MCP-1, and IL-10), and meta-\nbolic syndrome (MS) (including weight gain, glu-\ncose tolerance test with area under the curve,\ninsulin resistance index assessed by HOMA-IR,\nserum lipid profile including total cholesterol (TC),\ntriglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein-C (LDL-\nC) and high-density lipoprotein-C (HDL-C) and\natherogenic index, non-alcoholic fatty liver score\nand serum aspartate transaminase (AST) and ala-\nnine transaminase (ALT), and analysis of fecal\nmicrobiota by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and\nserum LPS levels by LAL assay. The mice were then\neuthanized and white adipose tissue (WAT), which\nincludes visceral (vWAT), subcutaneous (sWAT),\nand epididymal (eWAT) fat pads, and liver weights\nwere taken. A portion of the liver was stored in 10%\nformalin for histological analysis. Tissues were snap\nfrozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at − 80 °C\nfor future analyses.\n\n2) Determination of 17β-estradiol effects on gut micro-\nbiome, metabolic endotoxemia, low-grade chronic\ninflammation, and metabolic syndrome: Ten-week-\nold male (M), female (F), and ovariectomized\n(OVX) mice maintained on control diet were pur-\nchased from Charles River Laboratories and divided\nin to five groups (n = 5/group), and were fed WD\nand 17β-estradiol (E2) from week 11 to week 17.\nThe five groups are (1) M, (2) F, (3) M+E2, (4)\nOVX, and (5) OVX+E2. E2 (Sigma, USA) was pre-\npared and given to groups 3 and 5 in the drinking\nwater as described previously [87]. E2 was dissolved\nin 95% ethanol (5 mg/mL). Solubilized E2 was\nadded to the drinking water to produce\n\n\x0cKaliannan et al. Microbiome           (2018) 6:205 \n\nPage 16 of 22\n\nconcentration of 4000 ng E2/mL water with final\nethanol concentration of 0.1%. Groups 1, 2, and 4\nreceived a normal drinking water bottle with 0.1%\nethanol. The water bottles were changed every week\nfor all the groups. After 6 weeks, mice were sub-\njected to analysis for markers of ME and systemic\nLGCI and MS as mentioned in section 1. The mice\nwere then euthanized and WAT and liver weights\nwere taken. A portion of the liver and duodenum\nwas stored in 10% formalin for histological analysis.\nTissues were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and\nthen stored at − 80 °C for future analyses.\n\n3) Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT): Mice from\neach group were individually housed for receiving\nantibiotic treatment to the end of the experiment.\nFecal microbiota in place of cecal microbiota was\ntransplanted for convenience and in order to\nminimize the number of animals used as donors.\nFMT with fecal content from donor male (M) mice\nthat were fed WD for 10 weeks was performed on\nfemale 10-week-old mice [19]. Before the microbial\ntransplantation, recipient mice (M → F) were\ntreated with a 200 μL antibiotic cocktail (ampicillin,\n1 g/l; metronidazole, 1 g/l; vancomycin, 0.5 g/l; neo-\nmycin, 0.5 g/l) (Sigma, USA) administrated by oral\ngavage once a day for 3 days. During the last 8 h of\nantibiotic treatment, mice were fed a WD to facili-\ntate subsequent colonization. Fresh fecal pellets\nfrom donors were immediately weighed and placed\ninto Ringer’s solution and then diluted to 10 mg/\nmL. Immediately after diluting the fecal materials,\nfecal solutions were gavaged (200 μL per mouse) to\n4-h-fasted female recipients. Control groups of mice\n(males and females) were force-fed with 200 μL of\ntransfer buffer alone to eliminate the effects of gav-\nage per se. Two days later, these mice received an-\nother gavage to exclude possibility of any\nunsuccessful inoculation. We conducted this FMT\nprocedure once a week for the next 3 weeks. After\nthe first microbiota gavage, all mice were fed a WD\nfor 20 weeks. Measurement of body composition\n(fat mass) was performed using nuclear magnetic\nresonance (NMR) technique (minispec Body Com-\nposition Analyzer based on Time Domain NMR)\nthat provides noninvasive and rapid measurement\nwithout anesthetics. Fecal samples from these three\ngroups (M/F/M → F; n = 5 per group) were col-\nlected after WD feeding for 20 weeks and three\nfecal samples from each group were subjected to\n16S rRNA sequencing.\n\n4) Antibiotic (ABX) treatment: 10-week-old male (n =\n\n5) and female (n = 5) mice maintained on chow diet\nwere switched to a WD until the age of 20 weeks to\ninduce sexual dimorphism in MS. After collecting\n\nserum and stool for baseline measurements, both\nmales and females receiving a WD started receiving\na broad spectrum antibiotic cocktail (ABX) contain-\ning ampicillin (1 g/l), vancomycin (500 mg/l), neo-\nmycin sulfate (1 g/l) (added to the drinking water),\nand metronidazole (100 mg/kg) (orally gavaged\nevery 12 h) for 6 weeks to deplete the gut micro-\nbiota [88]. Validation of successful depletion of gut\nmicrobiota after the antibiotic treatment was per-\nformed as described previously [88]. Briefly, bacter-\nial cultivation (both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria)\nof feces was performed on day 24 of the antibiotic\ntreatment mice as described previously [14]. The\ndetection limit of the assay (successful depletion)\nwas defined as 1 cfu/mg feces. In addition, the bac-\nterial genomic DNA was extracted from fresh stool\nsamples of these mice and 16S rRNA gene copies\nfor all bacteria (Table S4) was measured with qPCR\nmethod as described below. Both bacterial cultiva-\ntion (cfu/mg feces) and qPCR results (Ct values)\nwere compared with results from pre-antibiotic\ntreatment fecal samples to confirm a significant de-\npletion of gut microbiota. Mice with antibiotic\ntreatment were subjected to analysis for markers of\nME and systemic LGCI and MS as mentioned in\nsection 1.\n\n5) Analysis of the effects of isoflavones (ISO) on gut\nmicrobiome, ME, LGCI, and MS: Ten-week-old\nmale (M) mice were fed a WD for 4 months to in-\nduce MS and then divided into two groups: group\n1: M, (n = 4), and group 2: M+ISO (n = 6). ISO such\nas genistein and daidzein (Cayman, USA) were sup-\nplemented at 0.1% in the WD, the M group was fed\na WD, and the M+ISO group was fed a WD supple-\nmented with ISO for the next 5 weeks. Mice were\nthen subjected to analysis for markers of ME and\nsystemic LGCI and MS as mentioned in section 1.\nThe mice were then euthanized and white adipose\ntissue (WAT) and liver weights were taken. A por-\ntion of the liver and duodenum was stored in 10%\nformalin for histological analysis. Tissues were snap\nfrozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at − 80 °C\nfor future analyses.\n\n6) Analysis of the effects of intestinal alkaline\n\nphosphatase (IAP) inhibition on gut microbiome,\nME, LGCI, and metabolic abnormalities: To\ndetermine the effects of inhibiting endogenous IAP\nactivity, 12-week-old WT mice on a WD were di-\nvided into three groups ((male (M), female (F), and\nF+L-phe)) (n = 5 per group) and allowed to drink\nautoclaved water alone or water containing 10 mM\nL-phenylalanine (L-phe) (Sigma, USA). After\n8 weeks, the serum and fecal samples were collected\nto analyze the markers of ME, LGCI, and MS.\n\n\x0cKaliannan et al. Microbiome           (2018) 6:205 \n\nPage 17 of 22\n\nExtraction of genomic DNA and profiling of the 16S rRNA\ngene by next generation\nSequencing\n\nFecal DNA extraction and 16S rRNA gene sequen-\ncing Bacterial genomic DNA was extracted from fresh\nstool samples (100–180 mg) using the QIAamp DNA\nStool Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), following the man-\nufacturer’s instructions. To increase effectiveness, the lysis\ntemperature was increased to 95 °C. Eluted DNA was\ntreated with RNase and analyzed using a Nanodrop spec-\ntrophotometer (Biotek, Winooski, VT). Sample concentra-\ntion and purity was determined by absorbance at 260 nm\nand the A260/A280 ratio, respectively. DNA samples\npacked with dry ice were shipped to APC Microbiome\nInstitute (University College Cork, Cork, Ireland), and\nsamples were sequenced as previously mentioned [37].\nBriefly, V3–V4 amplicons for Illumina sequencing were\ngenerated according to the 16S metagenomic sequencing\nlibrary protocol (Illumina). An initial PCR reaction utilized\nprimers specific for amplification of the V3–V4 region of\nthe 16S rRNA gene, (Forward primer 5′TCGTCGGCA\nGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGCCTACGGGNG\nGCWGCAG; reverse primer 5′ GTCTCGTGGGCTCG\nGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGGACTACHVGGGTATC\nTAATCC). PCR product clean-up and purification was\nachieved using the Agencourt AMPure XP system (Lab-\nplan, Dublin,\nIreland). A second PCR incorporated a\nunique indexing primer pair for each sample (Illumina\nNextera XT indexing primers, Illumina, Sweden). The\nproducts were again purified using the Agencourt AMPure\nXP system. Samples were quantified using the Qubit broad\nrange DNA quantification assay kit (Bio-Sciences, Dublin,\nIreland). Following quantification, samples were pooled in\nequimolar amounts (4 nM) and sequenced at Clinical\nMicrobiomcs, Copenhagen, Denmark, using Illumina\nMiSeq 2 × 300 bp paired end sequencing.\n\na)Bioinformatics Three hundred-base pair paired-end\nreads were assembled using FLASH with parameters of\na minimum overlap of 20 bp and a maximum overlap of\n120 bp [89]. The QIIME suite of tools, v1.8.0, was used\nfor further processing of paired-end reads,\nincluding\nquality filtering based on a quality score of > 25 and re-\nmoval of mismatched barcodes and sequences below\nlength thresholds [90]. Denoising, chimera detection,\nand operational taxonomic unit (OTU) grouping were\nperformed in QIIME using USEARCH v7 [91]. Taxo-\nnomic ranks were assigned by alignment of OTUs using\nPyNAST to the SILVA SSURef database release 111 [92].\nGeneration of α and β diversities and analysis and\nvisualization of principal coordinate analysis (PCoA)\nplots were performed using PAST and XLSTAT software.\nThe α-diversity of each group was calculated based on\n\nthe annotated data using the diversity indices of the PAST\nversion 2.17 software program [93]. Based on a non-para-\nmetric two-sample t-test using the default number of\nMonte Carlo permutations (999), comparative analyses of\nthe group-specific α-diversity indices were performed. Or-\ndinations are the dimensional-reduction techniques which\nare commonly used to visualize complex relationships\nbetween communities between groups (β-diversity). Di-\nmensional reduction of the Bray-Curtis distance between\nmicrobiome samples using PCoA ordination method\n(PAST software) was done and significant differences\namong groups were tested with permutational multivari-\nate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA), a multivariate\nnon-parametric one-way ANOVA, which utilizes the\nsample-to-sample Bray-Curtis distance matrix directly.\nTaxa which were primarily responsible for an observed\ndifference between groups were identified by SIMPER\n(similarity percentage analysis) method and their contri-\nbution to groups (between and within groups) were ana-\nlyzed using the PCA variance-covariance type ordination\n(PAST software) method. Differential abundance analysis\n(non-parametric ANOVA with Benjamini-Hochberg FDR-\ncorrected P values < 0.05) was performed on the RA of\nmicrobiota data at different levels of taxonomy to identify\ntaxa with FDR-corrected P values < 0.05 (XLSTAT soft-\nware; Addinsoft, USA) [94] and then their RA (normalized\nto percentage) were shown by a heat map with hierarchal\nclustering (HCN) analysis [95] using GraphPad Prism ver-\nsion 7.01 (La Jolla, CA). Linear discriminant analysis\n(LDA) effect size (LEfSe) is a biomarker discovery and\nexplanation tool\nfor high-dimensional data. It couples\nstatistical significance with biological consistency and ef-\nfect size estimation [96]. Microbiota-based biomarker\ndiscoveries were done with LEfSe using the online galaxy\nserver (https://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/galaxy/), and\nthe LDA scores derived from LEfSe analysis [96] were\nused to show the relationship between taxon using a\ncladogram (circular hierarchical tree) of significantly in-\ncreased or decreased bacterial taxa in the gut microbiota\nbetween groups. Levels of the cladogram represent, from\nthe inner to outer rings, phylum, class, order, family, and\ngenus. Color codes indicate the groups, and letters indi-\ncate the taxa that contribute to the uniqueness of the cor-\nresponding groups at an LDA of > 2.0. Unweighted\npair-group method with arithmetic means (UPGMA) hier-\narchical clustering analysis diagram based on Bray-Curtis\ndistance matrix was obtained using PAST version 3.11.\nClass trees were used to demonstrate similarity between\nsamples, the clustering tree branch length was a measure\nof the cluster effect.\n\nb)Putative metagenome identification Microbial func-\ntions were predicted using 16S ribosomal RNA sequen-\ncing and phylogenetic reconstruction of unobserved\n\n\x0cKaliannan et al. Microbiome           (2018) 6:205 \n\nPage 18 of 22\n\nstates (PICRUSt) software (version 1.0.0) as described\n[29]. The predicted genes and functions were aligned to\nthe KEGG database (version 66.1, May 1, 2013). PCA\nand PERMANOVA statistics were applied to check\nwhether the groups were clustered according to pre-\ndicted gene enrichments for microbial functions. LEfSe\nanalysis [96] was utilized to determine significant puta-\ntive KEGG orthologs and pathway analyses [96].\n\nLipopolysaccharide (LPS) concentration\nSerum LPS concentrations were measured with a Toxin\nSensor Chromogenic Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL)\nEndotoxin Assay Kit (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ), follow-\ning the manufacturer’s instructions [15]. Briefly, serum\nsamples were diluted 10- to 50-fold with endotoxin-free\nwater, adjusted to the recommended pH, and heated for\n10 min at 70 °C to minimize inhibition or enhancement\nby contaminating proteins. LAL reagents were added to\nserum and incubated at 37 °C for 45 min, and the ab-\nsorbance was read at 545 nm. All samples were validated\nfor recovery and internal coefficient variation using\nknown amounts of LPS.\n\nIntestinal permeability\nIntestinal permeability was determined as previously de-\nscribed [15]. Briefly, mice were gavaged with phosphate\nbuffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) containing 600 mg/kg body\nweight FITC-dextran (40 kDa, Sigma-Aldrich, USA).\nBlood samples (120 μL) were collected after 90 min.\nSerum was diluted with an equal volume of PBS, and\nfluorescence intensity was measured using a fluorospec-\ntrophotometer (excitation wavelength 480 nm and emis-\nsion wavelength 520 nm; Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA).\nSerum FITC-dextran concentrations were calculated\nfrom a standard curve of serially diluted FITC-dextran\nin PBS.\n\nMeasurement of intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP)\nlevel and activity\nSmall intestinal IAP specific activity (as it relates to pro-\ntein) was measured as previously described [15] and\nexpressed as picomoles pNPP hydrolyzed/min/μg of pro-\ntein. Briefly, thoroughly washed duodenal tissues were\nhomogenized with lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 10 mM\nTris·HCl, pH 7.5, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet\nP-40, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, including protease in-\nhibitor mixture; Sigma) followed by incubation on ice\nfor 30 min. Thereafter, the homogenates were centri-\nfuged twice at 4 °C at 15,000g for 15 min, and the super-\nnatants were collected to determine IAP activity as well\nas protein concentration. The Coomassie Blue Protein\nAssay (Bradford) kit from Fisher Scientific was used for\nprotein quantification. For IAP assay, 25 μL of super-\nnatant was mixed with 175 μL phosphatase assay reagent\n\ncontaining 5 mM of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP)\nfollowed by determining optical density at 405 nm. The\nspecific activity of the enzyme was expressed as pico-\nmoles pNPP hydrolyzed/min/μg of protein. Protein con-\ncentration in a specific sample was determined using the\nprotein assay reagents from Fisher Scientific.\n\nCell culture experiments\nThe human colon carcinoma cell line (Caco-2) was ob-\ntained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)\n(Rockville, MD) and cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s\nmodified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Corning Inc., NY,\nUSA) containing 4.5 g/l glucose, 4 mmol/l L-glutamine,\nand 1 mmol/l sodium pyruvate, and supplemented with\n10% fetal bovine serum (Cell Applications, Inc., San\nDiego, CA), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL\nstreptomycin (Gibco, NY, USA) in a humidified atmos-\nphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. They were routinely subcul-\ntured when they were about 80% confluent. The culture\nmedium was changed every other day. Cells were always\n> 90% viable, as shown by trypan blue (Invitrogen, Carls-\nbad, CA, USA) exclusion. Cells were passaged every 3–\n4 days by treatment with 0.1% trypsin (Gibco) and 0.04%\nethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and then plated\nat a density of 1.3–2 × 104 cells/cm2. Cells at passage\nnumber 17 were used for the experiments. All assays\nwere done using only differentiated Caco-2. Cells were\nseeded in to six-well plates at 2 × 104 cells per well and\ntreated with vehicle (ethanol or DMSO) or 10 nM\n17β-estradiol (E2) for 24, 48, and 72 h or each 25 μM\ngenistein (G) or daidzein (D) or G+D mixture for 72 h.\nIn a\nexperiments, Caco-2 cells were\npre-treated with L-phenylalanine (10 mM) for 24 h and\nthen they were treated with either vehicle or each\n25 μM G+D mixture or 10 nM E2 for 72 h. Medium\nwas removed and cells were washed twice with ice-cold\nPBS, scraped, lysed in Trizol (Invitrogen), and stored at\n− 80 °C until mRNA was isolated or homogenized with\n200 μL radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer\n(50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton\nX-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl\nsulfate) containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma),\nincubated on ice for 30 min, centrifuged at 14,000g for\n10 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was collected and\nstored at − 80 °C for western blotting analysis.\n\nsubset of\n\nWestern blotting analysis of IAP\nWestern blotting on tissues and Caco-2 cell lysates was\nperformed as previously described [14]. After thawed,\nthe protein samples derived from Caco-2 cells, the ho-\nmogenates were centrifuged at 15,000g at 4 °C for\n15 min, and the supernatants were collected. The duo-\ndenum section of small intestinal tissues was harvested\nand cut open longitudinally and luminal contents were\n\n\x0cKaliannan et al.

The tissues were washed with PBS and ho-\nmogenized with liquid nitrogen, and homogenates were\nmixed with RIPA buffer, incubated on ice for 30 min,\nand centrifuged at 14,000g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the\nsupernatant was collected. Protein concentration of\nCaco-2 and tissue homogenates was quantified by the\nCoomassie blue protein assay (Thermo Scientific, Rock-\nford, IL, USA) using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the\nstandard. Proteins (30 μg) were resolved on SDS-PAGE\ngels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes\n(Osmonics, Minnetonka, MN, USA). The membranes\nwere blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered\nsaline with 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T) for 1 h at room\ntemperature and then probed with IAP primary anti-\nbodies (GTX27322, GeneTex, San Antonio, TX, USA) in\n5% non-fat dry milk in TBS-T at 4 °C overnight. After\nwashing three times in TBS-T, the blots were further in-\ncubated with the corresponding secondary antibodies\nconjugated with horseradish peroxidase for 1 h at room\ntemperature (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz,\nCA). Chemiluminescence was detected with Pierce ECL\nwestern blotting substrate (Thermo Scientific, Rockford,\nIL, USA) and visualized by ChemiDoc MP Imaging Sys-\ntem (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).\n\nImmunohistochemical analysis of IAP\nFormalin-fixed duodenal tissues and IAP primary anti-\nbodies (GTX27322, GeneTex) [14] were given to MGH\ncore (Boston, MA). Prepared IHC slides were analyzed\nunder light microscope and images of IAP staining and\nlocalization was taken by using × 20 magnifications. All\npictures were taken with the same exposure conditions\nwithout autoscaling.\n\nRV coefficient\nThe RV coefficient was calculated between the microbial\ngenera (FDR-corrected P value < 0.05) and the host pa-\nrameters (markers of ME, LGCI and MS). The RV coeffi-\ncient\nthe Pearson\ncorrelation coefficient [97].\n\nis a multivariate generalization of\n\nCorrelation network analysis\nNetwork-based analytical approaches have the potential\nto help disentangle complex host-microbe interactions\n[98]. Pairwise correlations between each microbiota\n(genera that are present at < 0.1% relative abundance in\n> 75% samples have been removed to avoid detecting\nspurious correlations among low-abundance OTUs) and\nhost parameter (markers of ME, LGCI, and MS) were\ncalculated using Spearman’s nonparametric rank correl-\nation coefficient [99]. Using those significant (P < 0.05)\ncorrelation coefficients, a correlation network (Fruchter-\nman Reingold and label adjust layout) was built where\nnodes represent either a microbiota or a host parameter.\n\nFor each microbiota and a host parameter, an undirected\nedge was added between the corresponding nodes in the\ncorrelation network. Edges (light black links indicate\npositive and blue links indicate negative associations)\nrepresent statistically significant correlations (P < 0.05).\nCorrelations were calculated using the PAST software\nversion 2.17 and the network was visualized in Gephi\nGraph Visualization and Manipulation software version\n0.9.2 [100]. Nodes were colored based on “data type”\nand sized based on “betweeness centrality (BC).” BC is a\nnetwork centrality measure that quantifies the influence\nof a node in connecting other nodes in a network. It rep-\nresents the fraction of all shortest paths in the network\nthat pass through a given node. The nodes with the\nhighest BC are usually known as highly central or hubs.\nA “module or component” in the network is a set of\nnodes connected to each other by many links, while\nconnected by few links to nodes of other groups, so\nmodules are elementary units of any biological network,\nand their identification and characterization provides us\nwith more information about the local interaction pat-\nterns in the network and their contribution to the over-\nall structure, connectivity, and function of the network.\nModules are biologically important when considered as\nisolated, taxonomic, evolutionary, or functional modules.\nHigh modularity indicates that the network has dense\nconnections within certain groups of nodes and sparse\nconnections between these groups.\n\nMultivariate statistical analysis\nPartial least square regression (PLS-R) was used to asso-\nciate the microbial composition to host parameters in-\ncluding jackknife-based variable selection [98]. PLS-R is\nrecommended in cases of regression where the number\nof explanatory variables is high, and where it is likely\nthat\nthe explanatory variables are correlated. Leave\none-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) was applied. The Q2\ncumulated index (Q2cum) measures the global goodness\nof fit and the predictive quality of the models. Q2cum is\nalso used to test\nthe model against\nthe validity of\nover-fitting. The cumulated R2Y and R2X cum that cor-\nresponds to the correlations between the explanatory\n(X) and dependent (Y) variables with the components\nare very close to one with two components in all the\nmodels. This indicates that the two components gener-\nated by the PLR-R summarize well both the Xs and the\nYs. The results are also presented in PLS scatter plots\nfor subject clustering and variables. The R2 (coefficient\nof determination) indicates the % of variability of the\ndependent variable (Y) which is explained by the\nexplanatory variables (X). Parameters (variable import-\nance in the projection values 1 or > 1.0) contributing to\nthe multivariate PLS models were compared with the\ncorresponding identified modules (Fig. 7b–d)\nin the\n\n\x0cKaliannan et al.
