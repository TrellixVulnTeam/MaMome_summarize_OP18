['1 Comparison between 16S rRNA gene sequencing and shotgun metagenomic sequencing\n\nTwo primary methods for taxonomic proﬁling of microbial communities exist: 16S gene sequencing and whole genome shotgun sequencing (WGS).\nThe advantages and disadvantages of 16S gene sequencing versus WGS methods for the purpose of taxonomic proﬁling are listed in the following.\n\n1.1 Advantages of 16S rRNA sequencing\n\nCost: currently, 16S gene sequencing is signiﬁcantly more cost-eﬀective than WGS and requires less starting material than WGS [5]. The low cost of\n16S gene sequencing is one of the primary reasons for its widespread use.\n\n1.2 Disadvantages of 16S rRNA sequencing\n\n• No gold standard hyper-variable region: The full 16S gene sequence length cannot be sequenced by all sequencing technologies (short-read\nsecond-generation platforms). Thus, the hyper-variable regions need to be sequenced instead. However, there is no consensus about choice of\nhyper-variable regions inﬂuencing the phylogenetic resolution [14].\n\n• Precision of taxonomic assignment: 16S rRNA sequencing has a lower precision compared to WGS in taxonomic assignment [15]. While\nWGS may be used to assign species-level classiﬁcations to many sequences with conﬁdence, 16S rRNA sequencing classiﬁcation is typically\nrestricted to the genus-level, with species-level predictions based on OTUs being of generally lower precision [16]. In addition, fungal and viral\ngenomes, which do not contain 16S rRNA genes and thus are not picked up with 16S rRNA sequencing, are sequenced during WGS.\n\n• Bias: 16S rRNA sequencing suﬀers from signiﬁcant PCR ampliﬁcation biases. This is a result of diﬀerences in PCR primer binding to certain\n16S rRNA gene sequences, which may cause entire groups of bacteria to be underrepresented in the sample [5]. In addition to PCR ampliﬁcation\nbiases, over estimation of α diversity and proﬁling pipeline can also introduce biases in the 16S rRNA data [14]. WGS is a comparatively\nunbiased method for taxonomic proﬁling.\n\n2 Evaluation metrics\n\n2.1 Precision, Recall, F1\n\nPrecision, recall (sensitivity), and F1 are among the most popular metrics for evaluation of classiﬁcation performance in machine learning. Precision\nand recall are deﬁned as:\n\nP recision =\n\nT rueP ositive\nT rueP ositive + F alseP ositive\n\n, Recall =\n\nT rueP ositive\nT rueP ositive + F alseN egative\n\n,\n\nF1 score (0 ≤ F 1 ≤ 1) is the harmonic average of the precision and recall maintaining a balance between both precision and recall:\n\nF1 =\n\n2\n1\nrecall +\n\n1\nprecision\n\n2\n\n\x0c2.2 Micro versus Macro averaged metrics\n\nIn the evaluation, we distinguish between micro and macro metrics. Micro-averaging is average of metrics over instances (samples), while macro\naveraging computes the metrics for each class separately and then simply average over classes. Macro-metrics are useful when we want to give equal\nimportance to all categories, although the categories are imbalanced.\n\nIn this paper in order to provide detailed information on how our classiﬁers perform in both micro and macro cases, we have reported both micro-\nand macro- averaging precision and recall. In particular we optimized our classiﬁers for macro-F1 to make a trade of between precision and recall as\nwell as giving equal importance to all categories.\n\n3 Visualization Methods\n\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA): is one of the most widely used techniques for dimensionality reduction. PCA provides us with the principal\ndirections (V s) in which the data exhibits maximum variation. These principal directions are the eigenvectors of the data covariance matrix and the\neigenvalue corresponding to each eigenvector indicates the variance of the data in that particular direction. Thus, by a linear transformation we can\nproject the data to a low-dimensional space with principal directions as the axes. Despite its widespread use in modern data analysis, PCA has some\nlimitations. Since PCA involves covariance matrix estimation and eigenvalue decomposition, the computational complexity of PCA for M samples,\neach represented with m features, is of the order O(m2M + m3). In addition, in order to have a reliable estimation of the covariance matrix, PCA\nrequires a large number of samples and typically underperforms with limited numbers of data points. Finally, PCA is a linear transformation with\nseveral constraints, and thus cannot address the non-linearity in the data [18, 1].\n\nt-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE): is a dimensionality reduction technique which has been successfully applied to\nvisualization problems, since it attempts to preserve pairwise distance distribution of points in lower dimensions [19]. Since projection to lower\ndimensions involves the distribution of relative distances, it requires large amounts of data points in order to ﬁnd a meaningful representation. t-SNE\nis a nonlinear transformation with a computational complexity of O(M 2). However, a recent implementation of t-SNE has been reported to have a\ncomputational complexity of O(M log(M )) [20]. t-SNE is a relatively new technique in machine learning, and only recently has been used for the\nanalysis of genomic data [2, 13, 3, 12].\n\nSupervised representation learning: both PCA and t-SNE are unsupervised methods, meaning that the output representation is trained\nindependently from the instances’ categories. Deep neural models provide a powerful framework for training multiple levels of representation for the\ninput data in both unsupervised and supervised manners. In supervised training, like multi-class classiﬁcation task, specialized representations of the\ninput data are trained using the back-propagation algorithm [17]. In such framework, the activation function of the last hidden-layer for the input\ndata is a specialized representation of data for that particular task or even other tasks [4]. Such a representation trained in a supervised manner can\nalso be visualized using t-SNE or other visualization techniques.\n\n4 Body-site classiﬁcation results\n\n4.1 Confusion matrix for body-site classiﬁcation using diﬀerent sampling sizes\n\nAs shown in the Figure 1, increase in the sampling size from 100 reads per sample helps in discrimination between similar body-sites (mid-vagina and\nurogenital). However, further increases (more then 5000 reads per sample) results in over-ﬁtting.\n\n3\n\n\x0c(a) Sampling size: 100 reads per sample\n\n(b) Sampling size: 1000 reads per sample\n\n(c) Sampling size: 5000 reads per sample\n\n(d) Sampling size: 10000 reads per sample\n\n(e) Using all reads\n\nFigure 1: The confusion matrix for the classiﬁcation of 5 major body-sites for diﬀerent sampling sizes, using Random Forest classiﬁer in a 10xfold\ncross-validation scheme.

Crohns disease is an inﬂammatory bowel\ndisease (IBD) with a prevalence of approximately 40 per 100,000 and 200 per 100,000 in children and adults, respectively [9]. In contrast to Ulcerative\nColitis, which exhibits shallow inﬂammation of the tissue, Crohns disease is characterized by ulcerous transmural inﬂammation that extends deep into\nthe tissue of the gut [10]. Previous genome-wide association studies have demonstrated a link between intestinal microbe response pathways and IBD\ndevelopment [7]. This evidence, along with observations of signiﬁcantly altered microbiome compositions in IBD patients in humans, points towards\na role for the microbiome in the regulation of IBD. While the mechanism for this regulation is not well understood, it is thought that dysbiosis of the\nintestinal microbiome may impact the immune system within the intestine, leading to the progression of Crohns disease.\n\n5.1 Bootstrapping result for Crohn’s disease dataset\nSimilar to bootstrapping for the body-site dataset, ¯DSand ¯DR for diﬀerent values of k with respect to sampling sizes are shown in Figure 2. The\nstructure of the curve is similar to the body-site dataset. For each k, the interval that ¯DS and ¯DR converge to their minimum values show a propoer\nrange for picking a sampling size resulting in self-consistent and representative representations.\n\n6 Ecological environments classiﬁcation results\n\nThe confusion matrix for 18-way classiﬁcation of ecological environments is shown in Figure 3. The confusion matrix shows that most of the major\nmiss-classiﬁcations are due to similarities between the environment pairs, examples are (marine sediment, sediment), (food, food fermentation), and\n(marine, aquatic).\n\n7 Organismal environment classiﬁcation results\n\nThe confusion matrix for the task of classifying the 5 organisms’ gut environments is presented in Figure 4. In addition, visualizations of representative\n16S rRNA gene sequences in 5 organisms’ guts obtained through using PCA, t-SNE, and t-SNE on the activation function of the last layer of the\ntrained Neural Network is depicted in Figure 5.\n\n8 Representation creation run-time comparison\n\nA comparison between run-time for k-mer representation creation versus OTU picking for NIH Human Microbiome Project samples [11, 8] and Crohn’s\ndisease samples [6] are summarized in Table 1.\n\n5\n\n\x0cFigure 2: Measuring self-inconsistency ( ¯DS) and unrepresentativeness ( ¯DR) for the Crohn’s disease dataset. Each point presents the average of\n100 resamples belonging to 10 randomly selected 16S rRNA samples. Higher k values require higher sampling rates to produce self-consistent and\nrepresentative samples.\n\nDatabase\nCrohn’s disease\nBody-site\n\n# of samples Run-time for k-mers Run-time for OTU\n\n1359\n12075\n\n381 sec\n3339 sec\n\n5125 sec\n66996 sec\n\nTable 1: Run-time comparsion between OTU versus k-mer representation creation.\n\n6\n\n0200040006000800010000Resamplesize(N)0246810¯DS(N,k)(i)Self-inconsistency¯DS,withrespecttoresamplesize(N)demonstratedfordifferentkvaluesinthecrohndiseasedatasetk=3k=4k=5k=6k=7k=80200040006000800010000Resamplesize(N)0.000.020.040.060.080.10¯DR(N,k)(ii)Unrepresentativeness¯DR,withrespecttoresamplesize(N)demonstratedfordifferentkvaluesinthecrohndiseasek=3k=4k=5k=6k=7k=8\x0cFigure 3: Confusion matrix for classiﬁcation of 18 ecological environments using SVM classiﬁer.\n\n7\n\nactivatedsludgefreshwatersedimentantfungusgardencompostsoilbioreactorsludgefoodhotspringsgroundwaterrhizospheremarinebioreactorfoodfermentationsedimentaquaticmarinesedimenthydrocarbonfreshwaterPredictedlabelsfreshwaterhydrocarbonmarinesedimentaquaticsedimentfoodfermentationbioreactormarinerhizospheregroundwaterhotspringsfoodbioreactorsludgesoilcompostantfungusgardenfreshwatersedimentactivatedsludgeActuallabels1792695610027050810610032482157414125115172157602271719142341210110442415005956512281823756120441081632545302116446194178874710068241787510136724494077573142117845661614714025170534852142354464989182018002441835401002011937150250562101724520730381112428790289553708741106947621494664301810379121011424346827619519386141514071639579144933502013469321039181912393365106439206104124413404319111237224248944190828171153558777144758627285740133960887198011315701205288997421428221118103723321227211260177624621016867396042982684619618627756464177249184492026719317726211395677877249080262477421517929514274613565231379428014407110320215266404610969932150354130011608034502000400060008000\x0cFigure 4: Confusion matrix for classiﬁcation of 5 organismal environments using SVM classiﬁer.\n\n8\n\nhumangutchickengutbovinegutmouseguttermitegutPredictedlabelstermitegutmousegutbovinegutchickenguthumangutActuallabels41528305162853454949357133412582514747514403160100200300400500\x0cFigure 5: Visualization of 5 organismal environments using diﬀerent projection methods: (i) PCA over 6-mer distributions with unsupervised training,\n(ii) t-SNE over 6-mer distributions with unsupervised training, (iii) visualization of the activation function of the last layer of the trained Neural\nNetwork (projected to 2D using t-SNE).\n\n9\n\nPCA1PCA0(i)PCAover6-merrepresentationsbovinegutchickenguthumangutmouseguttermitegutt-SNE1t-SNE0(ii)t-SNEover6-merrepresentationsbovinegutchickenguthumangutmouseguttermitegutt-SNE1t-SNE0(iii)t-SNE/activationfunctionofthelastlayerofneuralnetworkbovinegutchickenguthumangutmouseguttermitegut\x0cReferences\n\n[1] Herv´e Abdi and Lynne J.
