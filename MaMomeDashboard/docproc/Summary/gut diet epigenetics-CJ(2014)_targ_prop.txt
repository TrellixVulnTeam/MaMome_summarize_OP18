Glucosinolates are converted into isothiocyanates (ITC) by either the plant myrosinases, or 
bacterially produced thioglucosidases. Previous studies have 
shown that certain species of bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Bacteroides 
thetaiotaomicron, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Peptostreptococcus sp. In particular, there was a positive association with DCA and colorectal 
adenomas, a precursor to colorectal cancer.103-109 In contrast, UDCA has been shown in 
animal and in vitro studies to reduce the risk of cancer dysplasia and cancer 
development110, 111 and, in a phase III clinical trial, UDCAs reduced the degree of dysplasia 
in colonic polyps.
