Competing interests: The authors have declared
that no competing interests exist. The first 50 consecutive sub-
jects who met both the criteria for GDM according to international guidelines (fasting plasma
glucose �92 mg/dL and/or 1h post-test glycemia �180 mg/dL and/or 2h post-test glycemia
�153 mg/dL) and the inclusion criteria (see below) were enrolled  Out of them, 41
women participated in an observational study aiming to evaluate the changes in gut micro-
biota composition across pregnancy  The fecal samples of their offspring were collected in
the first week of life. Finally, all mothers were suggested to breastfeed their children. However, only 10
of them followed this suggestion. Ethical aspects

The present study conforms to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written informed consent prior to
participation in the study protocol. Data relative to the type of delivery, birth weight, gestational age and the type of feeding were
extracted from medical records. Containers were immediately
stored at −80 ˚C for DNA extraction. One microliter of RNase
(Illumina Inc. San Diego. In order to identify sub-OTUs populations in our offspring cohort, reads assigned to genera

Blautia, Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium were extracted and entropy analysis and oligotyping
were carried out since these were the only OTUs showing higher level of entropy able to
obtain sub-OTUs. ADONIS and ANOSIM statistical test were used
to detect significant differences in the overall microbial community by using the unweighted
UniFrac distance matrices or OTU table. Patients with GDM showed a predominance of Firmicutes (increasing during the gesta-
tional period) and Bacteroidetes (whose relative abundance decreased), while the infant gut
microbiota was characterized by an increased relative abundance of Actinobacteria and Pro-
teobacteria (Fig 2). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0226545.g002

Infant gut microbiota and maternal dietary habits and laboratory variables

No clear separation of the infant gut microbiota was observed (anosim P > 0.05) according to
the maternal compliance to dietary recommendations (S2 Fig). The correlation plot between
maternal nutrient intakes and infant gut microbiota showed a higher number of significant
associations with maternal variables at enrolment than at the study-end (Fig 3). Maternal oligosaccharides derived mainly from dairy products, cereals, fruit and vegetables,

while saturated fatty acids (SFA) derived mainly from meat and cheese. Two out of 29 women were treated with insulin;
none received metformin. After adjusting for insulin treatment, the results of the multiple
regression analyses did not change. PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0226545 December 16, 2019

In order to explore the possible mother-to-infant gut microbiota transmission at sub-OTUs
level, we carried out oligotyping on sequences of Blautia, Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium
since these were the only genera showing a Shannon entropy index sufficient to identify all

GDM offspring gut microbiota composition

Fig 5. We then selected the oligotypes which were present in at least 5 mother-to-child
pairs. At phylum level, we
observed higher abundance of Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes in the offspring from GDM
women (S5A Fig) (P<0.001). Con-
trarily to a few previous human studies showing that the infant gut microbiota was associated
with the last-trimester maternal diet  we found stronger associations between infant gut
bacteria composition and early maternal nutrition. This hypothesis needs
to be confirmed by further studies. Heatplot showing OTUs of
