There are several recent reviews on sequencing and anal-
ysis  of  the  microbiome,  although  a  full  discussion  of  these 
methods  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this  review.28-31  In  brief,  com-
monly  used  methods  to  study  the  microbiome  use  either 
amplicon sequencing methods that analyze the partial genome 
or whole-genome shotgun metagenomic sequencing. In contrast, 
quantitative profiling of absolute counts of absolute microbial 
abundances may be as or more relevant to defining the role of 
microbiome  in  human  disease.32  A  small  study  of  29  patients 
with CD revealed microbial counts that were 3 times lower than 
those of healthy control patients and differences in defining an 
association between Bacteroides (noted only in relative profiling) 
and Prevotella (only in quantitative microbial profiling) in CD.32. Fecal  samples  were  obtained  at  therapy  cessation,  2  months, 
6 months, and the end of follow-up. Interestingly, although all patients were 
in clinical remission at study entry, a lower baseline abundance 
of F. prausnitzii (P = 0.014) and Bacteroides (P = 0.030) pre-
dicted relapse after therapy cessation in addition to biochem-
ical markers such as an elevated serum C-reactive protein. . Two OTUs affiliated with Faecalibacterium and Bacteroides were more abundant at . A total of 35% of the cohort remained in remission 
at week 54.
