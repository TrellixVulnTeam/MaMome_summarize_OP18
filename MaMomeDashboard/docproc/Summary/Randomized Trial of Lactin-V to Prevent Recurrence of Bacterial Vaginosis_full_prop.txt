Lactobacillus crispatus  CTV-05  (Lactin-V,  Osel) 
is  a  live  biotherapeutic  product  that  contains  a 
naturally occurring vaginal strain of L. crispatus. Copyright © 2020 Massachusetts Medical Society. Subsequently, participants were to 
administer four consecutive daily doses of Lactin-V 
or  placebo  during  week  1,  followed  by  twice-
weekly doses for 10 weeks. Ran-
domization was performed in permuted blocks 
with the use of the online enrollment module 
of  AdvantageEDC  software  (Emmes). Before  un-
blinding of the treatment-group assignments oc-
curred, a case-review committee identified par-
ticipants who had had protocol deviations, such 
as the use of prohibited medications, trial visits 
outside  the  protocol-specified  time  window,  or 
poor adherence to the assigned treatment; these 
participants were excluded from the per-protocol 
analyses (see the Methods section in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). The 
data from the questionnaire are not reported here.) In  addition,  at 
each  trial  visit,  participants  were  asked  about 
any other (unsolicited) adverse events. The severity of all ad-
verse  events  was  graded  according  to  grading 
tables  provided  by  the  Division  of  AIDS  of  the

The New England Journal of Medicine Downloaded from nejm.org at UPPSALA UNIVERSITY on May 13, 2020. Statistical Analysis
The efficacy analyses were performed in several 
analysis populations. For  the  intention-
to-treat  and  modified  intention-to-treat  analy-
ses, when diagnoses of bacterial vaginosis were 
missing, the data were imputed with the use of 
two  single-imputation  methods,  one  of  which 
was the last observation carried forward. The  widths  of  the  confidence  inter-
vals  were  not  adjusted  for  multiplicity,  so  the 
intervals should not be used to infer definitive 
treatment  effects  for  the  secondary  or  other 
outcomes. Enrollment, Randomization, and Follow-up. Efficacy
Primary Outcome
Among  the  228  participants  who  underwent 
randomization, the status of recurrence of bac-
terial vaginosis was known for 197 participants 
 In the intention-to-treat population, re-
currence  of  bacterial  vaginosis  by  week  12  oc-
curred in 46 participants in the Lactin-V 
group  and  in  34  participants   in  the  pla-
cebo group (risk ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence in-
terval [CI], 0.44 to 0.87; P = 0.01) (Table 2). Lactin-V to Prevent Recurrence of Bacterial Vaginosis

Among  the  participants  without  known  recur-
rence of bacterial vaginosis by week 12, a total 
of 13 of 106 participants in the Lactin-V 
group and 7 of 42 participants in the pla-
cebo  group  had  a  recurrence  by  week  24. †  This variable represents the primary outcome. The incidence and risk ratio for each vari-
