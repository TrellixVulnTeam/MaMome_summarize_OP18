number  of  pioneering  studies  have  employed  human-derived
Escherichia  coli  and  Bacteroides  spp. as  model  organisms  to  elucidate
key  principles  of  microbe–host  interactions  in  gnotobiotic  mice. These  bacteria  can  be  genetically  manipulated  and  allow  functional
genetic  analysis. Mono-colonization  of  mice  with  B.  theta  induces  pronounced
changes  in  host  mucosal  gene  expression  (Hooper  and  Gordon,
2001). B.  theta  was   shown  to  adapt  to  the  presence  of  Eubac-
terium  rectale  or  the  probiotic  strains  Biﬁdobacterium  longum  and
Lactobacillus  casei  by  expanding  the  breadth  of  its  carbohydrate
utilization  (Mahowald  et  al.,
