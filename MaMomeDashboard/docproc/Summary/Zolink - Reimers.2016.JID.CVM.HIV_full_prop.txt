the commonality that relates both BV and vaginal pH to HPV
infection (independent of HIV) is the RA of certain Lactobacil-
lus species, most notably L. crispatus. WIHS Substudy Population
As described previously  women included in the micro-
biome substudy were selected from among premenopausal
African American participants at the Chicago WIHS site,
with at least 8 years of observation and a minimum of 6 annual
CVL specimens, with further selection based on their HIV sta-
tus and CD4+ T-cell count over time. CVLs were obtained by irrigation of
the cervix with 10 mL of nonbacteriostatic sterile saline, fol-
lowed by aspiration from the posterior fornix. Microbial DNA was isolated using the FastDNA Spin Kit for
Soil (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH). Distribution of relative abundance (RA) of Lactobacillus species. It is a highly efﬁcient analytic method, widely
used in HPV research  In addition to CSTs, we conduct-
ed a priori–planned analyses of the RA of lactobacilli (at the
genus and species level), modeled as both continuous and ordi-
nal data. All covariates except study group were time
dependent. RESULTS

performed as described previously  Brieﬂy, universal
primers 27F and 338R were used for PCR ampliﬁcation of the
V1-V2 hypervariable regions of 16S rRNA genes from genomic
DNA extracts. Detection of chimeric se-
quences was performed using the UCHIME component of
UCLUST, and chimeric sequences were removed. Statistical Methods
We characterized demographic and risk factor data at the index
visit for each of the 3 study groups, with statistical differences
between groups assessed using analysis of variance (ANOVA;
for continuous variables), the Kruskal–Wallis test (for continu-
ous variables with nonnormal distributions), or the χ2 test (for
categorical data). of STIs in past

Data are no. (%) of participants or median value (interquartile range). See “Methods” section for details (substudy population). Figure 2 additionally shows the SDI for each study
visit, and as expected CSTs I through IV-A and V (each dom-
inated by a single Lactobacillus species) had a low SDI, com-
pared with CST IV-B. The ﬁgure also presents the proportion
of oncogenic HPV–positive women-visits for each CST. Cervicovaginal Microbiota and HPV (cid:129) JID 2016:214 1365

excluded from this substudy. Abbreviations: BV, bacterial vaginosis; CI, confidence interval; OR, odds ratio. a“Low” and “medium” denote the relative abundance of Lactobacillus species and L. iners, respectively. b A pH of ≤ 4.5 (the cut point used in the Amsel criteria for the diagnosis of BV) was considered low, a pH of 4.5–5.8 was considered medium, and a pH of >5.8 (where a pH of 5.8 was the
median of all pH values >4.5) was considered high. Lactobacillus species against STIs, most of that research
preceded widespread use of methods for comprehensively
assessing the cervicovaginal microbiome  The growing ev-
idence of species-speciﬁc (eg, L. crispatus–related) relationships
between the cervicovaginal microbiome and HPV infection ar-
gues against a signiﬁcant role of pH, since production of lactic
acid is a common attribute of lactobacilli as a group, and our
data showed that the greatest association with pH was with
the RA of Lactobacillus species, not for L. crispatus RA or
CSTs dominated by L. crispatus. Relation of Lactobacillus crispatus Relative Abundance to Detection of Human Papillomavirus (HPV)

All models were adjusted for age, study group, highly active antiretroviral therapy use, number of recent sex partners, smoking status, condom use, lifetime sex partners, Trichomonas vaginalis
infection in the past 6 months, Candida infection in the past 6 months, or other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the past 6 months. In summary, our results suggest a beneﬁcial effect of L. crisp-
atus on the burden of HPV in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected
women that is unrelated to pH. Further research to better un-
derstand these relationships is strongly warranted, including
large prospective cohort studies and laboratory research to un-
derstand the mechanisms that underlie the relation of the cer-
vicovaginal microbiota with HPV infection. The WIHS is funded primarily by the NIAID, with additional
