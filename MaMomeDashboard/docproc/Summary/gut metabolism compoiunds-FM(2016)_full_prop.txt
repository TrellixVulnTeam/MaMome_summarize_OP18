Gut Microbiota Metabolome

diseases may develop (Putignani et al., 2015), such as allergy,
inﬂammatory bowel disease
and
diabetes, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular dyslipidemia,
and neuropathology (Holmes et al., (IBD), obesity,

cancer

The advent of the omics-based systems biology era has opened
a new scenario in the comprehension of the gut ecosystem
by shedding light on its shape, modulation and interplay with
microorganisms, food functionality, and the role of nutrients in
health (Moco et al., (i)
The “omics” technologies are presently applied to:
determine speciﬁc disease markers and novel diagnostic targets;
(ii) discover functional alterations in the physiopathology of
several diseases; (iii) discover the relationship between the gut
microbiota and the host metabolisms (De Preter and Verbeke,
2013). In fact, metabolomics changed the concept
that the cellular metabolism proﬁle is complete (Dettmer et al., 2002); and (iv) characterize human health or disease
(Holmes et al., In fact,
the gut microbiota is involved in several biochemical functions
directly associated to the perturbation of speciﬁc gut microbial
populations, which may lead to the development of diseases
(De Preter, 2015; De Preter et al., 2012) the study of its composition helps
discriminate between unhealthy and healthy subjects. Considering
that the amount of predictable metabolites and derivatives in
mammals, plants and bacteria is unknown (Weckwerth and
Morgenthal, 2005), there is the need of diﬀerent analytical
platforms and complex integrated computational pipelines,
to cover
adjusted by analytical and chemical parameters,
complete metabolome pathways
in the diﬀerent bioﬂuids
