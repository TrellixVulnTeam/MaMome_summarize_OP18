Figure 1. Environmental factors shape and change the microbiome over time and perturbations can lead to disease. Maternal
factors: vaginal infections and gut microbiome can lead to bacterial translocation into the uterus. Postnatal factors: mode of
delivery, breastfeeding versus formula feeding, introduction of solid food, and early life adversity and antibiotic exposure can
shape the developing microbiome in early childhood. Environmental factors across the lifespan: long-term diet and exposure
to animals can modify the microbiome throughout childhood and adulthood. Perturbations to the microbiome: medications,
such as antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, and metformin, and a variety of different diets can make individuals more prone to
disease, such as inﬂammatory bowel disease, IBS, and obesity. Stress can lead to changes in the microbiome that affects
intestinal permeability and SCFA production. Smoking can cause microbial shifts that change inﬂammatory signaling and
colonic mucin production, all of which can be mechanisms that lead to the development of disease. Actinomycetales, and Alphaproteobacteria are associated
with preterm delivery, it has been shown that a variety of
other microbes may be present in the placenta, umbilical
cord, amniotic ﬂuid, and meconium of normal preg-
nancy.7–9 The maternal microbiome is likely translocated
into the uterus via the bloodstream, an idea supported by
the detection of labeled Enterococcus faecium in the
meconium of inoculated pregnant mice.7 In a recent
population-based study, researchers found the most
