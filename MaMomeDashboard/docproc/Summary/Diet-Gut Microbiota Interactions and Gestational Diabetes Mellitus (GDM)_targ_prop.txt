Women were considered as adherents to the given dietary recommendations if their intakes of
rapidly absorbed sugars and ﬁber were respectively <10% of total energy and at least 20 g/day,
and if they abolished alcohol intake at the end of the pregnancy. Adherents showed a signiﬁcant
decrease in Bacteroides  which is a genus that has been associated with high-fat animal-based
diets  Moreover, at enrolment, total fat intake was associated with higher abundance of Alistipes
and protein intake with Faecalibacterium genus, while, at the end of the pregnancy, ﬁber intake was
associated with the genus Roseburia  However, none of these bacteria were associated with the
changes in metabolic variables occurring during pregnancy in patients with GDM . From a “microbiota
point of view”, the high fat intake could potentially increase pro-inﬂammatory bacteria, resulting in
enhanced insulin resistance. Therefore,
overall, in GDM patients it could be hypothesized that there is a beneﬁcial effect resulting from the
increased consumption of foods containing arabinoxylans and β-glucans, such as rye, wheat, barley,
oats, sorghum, maize, millet, psyllium, and ﬂaxseed.
