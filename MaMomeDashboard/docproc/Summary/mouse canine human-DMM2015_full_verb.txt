Table 1. Humans also have an appendix,
which  is  absent  in  mice. Another difference is the presence of transverse folds
along the length of the colonic mucosa in humans, whereas these
folds are restricted to the cecum and proximal colon in mice. Overall, the mammalian digestive tract is strongly conserved, with
major differences between species being likely driven by diet. The morphology of mouse and human colons also
differs: the human colon is divided into haustra, whereas the mouse
colon is rather smooth. D is reproduced from the

Microbiome Project Consortium, 2012; Yatsunenko et al., For instance, Prevotella abundance
is  known  to  be  low  in  mouse  gut  microbiota  (Hildebrand  et  al., However, a recent study investigating microbiota across
human body habitats suggests that low-abundance genera might play
more important roles, because they are ubiquitous in different sites
of the body (Li et al., Obesity
The influence of diet on the gut microbiota has received increasing
research attention over recent years. On the other hand, a study on wild
mice by Wang et al. A reduced ratio
of Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes was also found in a study linking gut
microbiota composition and metabolic adaptations in mice on high-
fat diets (Serino et al., In
addition,  by  using  germ-free  and  leptin-deficient  (ob/ob)  mice,
Bäckhed and colleagues were able to suggest other mechanisms by
which  the  gut  microbiota  could  regulate  fat  storage  in  the  host
(Bäckhed et al., This said, some prominent changes in the gut microbiota
have been concomitantly observed in independent IBD studies using
a  variety  of  techniques  on  different  cohorts,  such  as  reduced
bacterial  diversity  in  both  Crohn’s  disease  and  ulcerative  colitis
patients (Andoh et al., C, intestinal crypts; G, goblet cells; L, lamina
propria; ME, muscularis externa; MM, muscularis mucosae; MT: muscularis tunics; SM: submucosa; V: villi. content in diets of both humans and mice (Akaza, 2012; Menon et
al., This  result  contradicts  the
observation  that  germ-free  mice,  either  immune-deficient  or
immune-competent,  are  resistant  to  DSS-induced  colitis  as
compared  with  their  respective  conventionally  housed  mice,  as
reported in the study by Hudcovic et al. ( This study shows that the gut
microbiota  composition  of  humanized  mice  in  general  does  not
differ significantly from that of the initial human donors, except for
the absence of many low-abundance Firmicutes, but these mice fail
to recapitulate a comprehensive response to infections. Similarly,  although  the  gap  between  humanized
mouse models and the human gut microbiota within its original host
needs to be acknowledged, these models provide unique possibilities
to manipulate the human microbiota and potentially assess causality
in the role of the gut microbiota in health and disease. Furthermore,  it  was  hypothesized  that  the
differences  between  mice  and  rats  in  recapitulating  the  human
donors’  microbiota  is  due  to  the  intrinsic  differences  in  genetic
backgrounds of the recipient models, which might control for the
establishment of the transferred microbiota (Wos-Oxley et al., Because a healthy commensal
intestinal microbiota affects the potential for infection by a pathogen
(pathogen exclusion), the gut microbiota of guinea pigs has been
investigated in several studies (Hildebrand et al., The  pig  gut  microbiota  is  becoming  an
increasingly intensive area of study owing to the scale of the pig
husbandry  industry,  as  well  as  to  the  similarities  in  anatomy,
physiology  and  immunology  to  the  human  gastrointestinal  tract
(Litten-Brown  et  al., At the
genus level, the swine gut microbiota harbors more Spirochaetes and
Prevotella than 
Interestingly,
Anaerovibrio and  Treptonema are  genera  exclusive  to  pig  fecal
metagenomes  (Lamendella  et  al., In  addition,  even  well-controlled  gut  microbiota
experiments  using  mouse  models  show  important  inter-study
variations due to confounding factors in the experimental setup, such
as mouse house origin, maternal effects, environmental conditions
(food composition, light, stress factors, pathogen infection), genetic
backgrounds  and  in  the  downstream  analysis  methods  applied. Acknowledgements
