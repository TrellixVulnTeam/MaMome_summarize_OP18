bowel syndrome (IBS). Moreover, the various benefits of 
prebiotics on human health, the microbiome–nutrient inter-
action and the role of vitamins in promoting the selective 
growth of microbes in the gut as well as determinants of 
the development of a healthy microbiome were presented 
and discussed intensively. and

show that 4.5% of the variance in BMI is attributable to the 
gut microbiome 

Analysis of the gut microbiome revealed that the use of 
proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) was associated with a signifi-
cant decrease in gut microbiota diversity and with signifi-
cant changes of around 20% of bacterial taxa. It is known since long that birth 
mode, feeding mode and antibiotic exposure, all affect the 
development of the neonatal microbiome. There-
fore, the introduction of probiotic or symbiotic nutritional 
approaches are put forward by researches to prevent, delay, 
or ease neurological disorders in the future (see: .
