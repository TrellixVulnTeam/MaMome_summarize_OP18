environmental exposures (Brown et al., The focus of this review, therefore, is the gut microbiome as it is 
commonly defined, limited to the intestines. The gut microbiome provides a broad range of functions. When conditions like maternal obesity, gestational diabetes or a leaky 
gut shift the maternal inflammatory state from a physiologic to an excessive level, vascular 
dysfunction of the placental tissue can develop leading to deleterious effects such as fetal 
growth restriction and preeclampsia (Kashtanova et al., 2016; Kim, Romero, 
Chaemsaithong, & Kim, 2015). Author manuscript; available in PMC 2018 November 01. Author Manuscript

Edwards et al. Conversely, certain 
dietary nutrients, namely low-fat protein (for instance beans, skinless chicken, lean beef), 
organic proteins and produce (which reduces exposure to dietary antibiotics and pesticides), 
unsaturated fatty acids (for instance in canola and olive oils, flaxseeds, and salmon), whole 
grains, and certain strains of probiotics have been found to promote a healthy gut 
microbiome, enhance intestinal integrity and reduce excessive systemic inflammation 
(Griffin, 2015; Kashtanova et al., Studies of 
omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) also suggest protection of the 
intestinal wall through strengthening of cellular connections (Li et al., In a healthy 

MCN Am J Matern Child Nurs. Disproportionate rates of infections have been found in chronically 
stressed minority populations and are thought to be a source of higher rates of preterm birth 
in these populations through dysbiotic gut microbe translocation mechanisms previously 
described (Culhane, Rauh, & Goldenberg, 2006; Mendez, Hogan, & Culhane, 2014). Estrogen and progesterone impact the 
composition of the gut microbiome through their effect on bacterial metabolism and growth 
and virulence of pathogenic bacteria (Mulak et al., Yet, as the pregnancy advances, the abundance of gut bacteria associated with 
inflammatory states increases in nearly 70% of women (Santacruz et al., Negative 
interference with the brain-gut axis (depicted on right side of Figure 1) during these times is 
associated with a higher maternal and child risk for chronic intestinal disorders, conditions 
which affect weight and growth, and even neuropsychiatric disorders (Mayer, Knight, et al., Health care recommendations that promote the IOM guidelines for maternal weight 
gain by prepregnant BMI category, high quality diet and gut eubiosis should be considered 
in the delivery of prenatal care and in client education. Appropriate 
type, duration and indication of prebiotic, probiotic and antibiotic use in the prevention and 
treatment of illness will become an important topic for discussion with clients in the future, 
since all act on the gut microbiome and may impact overall health and gestational weight 
gain (Griffin, 2015). There are no current clinical guidelines to facilitate these discussions 
pending further research. In a recent clinical trial, supplementation with specific strains of probiotics, such as 
Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Lactobacillus acidophilus, combined with dietary 
counseling have been found to improve glucose metabolism in healthy pregnant and 
lactating women (Brantsaeter et al.,
