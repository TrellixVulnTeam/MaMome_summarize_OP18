infant nutrition, and common clinical practices in neonatal
care  We hypothesize that assembly and function
of the preterm infants’ gut microbiota is associated with
postnatal growth patterns and represents a yet unexplored
personalized therapeutic potential for optimizing infant
development. We found that mode of
delivery was not significantly associated with microbiota
composition after controlling for age, which is similar to
recent studies where mode of delivery was not associ-
ated with the influence of breast milk in preterm infants
or with stool composition in full-term infants 
Overall, PMA has the strongest impact on microbiota
composition, followed by the ratio of enteral calories,
total calories normalized by body weight, proportion of
dietary lipids, antimicrobial usage, proportion of dietary
protein, and diuretics usage (Additional file 1: Table S1). To characterize the apparent
developmental phases of
the premature infant gut
microbiome, we used threshold values for the log ratio
the three predominant bacterial classes—Bacilli,
of
Gammaproteobacteria, and Clostridia—to construct a
decision tree that permits objective assignment of indi-
vidual microbiota samples to one of the three phases
based on their composition . As an example, the linear associations of P2
and percent lipids * P2 with the weight z-score are both
significant (beta = − 0.7766 for P2 and 5.658 for lipids *
P2); meaning that while P2 is correlated with a smaller
weight z-score as compared with the baseline (P3), a
higher percent of lipid intake for P2 subjects increases
the weight Z-scores for subjects in P2. ZIP 536 kb)
