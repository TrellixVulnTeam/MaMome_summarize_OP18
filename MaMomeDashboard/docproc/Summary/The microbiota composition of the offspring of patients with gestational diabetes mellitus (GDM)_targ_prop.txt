Blautia, Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium were extracted and entropy analysis and oligotyping
were carried out since these were the only OTUs showing higher level of entropy able to
obtain sub-OTUs. A cladogram of representative sequences was generated using the ANVIOs
software . abundance of the Blautia oligotypes increased during the pregnancy and were lower in the
infants (S4A Fig). Amenta, Clara Monzeglio, Roberto Gambino, Simona Bo..
