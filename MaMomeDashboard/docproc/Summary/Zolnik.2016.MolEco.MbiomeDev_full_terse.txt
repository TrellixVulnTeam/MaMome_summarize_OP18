example, infection of blacklegged ticks by A. phagocy-
tophilum (the causative agent of granulocytic anaplas-
mosis in humans) has been shown to induce protein
expression that increases cold tolerance and, depend-
ing on weather patterns, may aid in tick survival
(Neelakanta et al. In addition to investigating the internal
microbial communities found within whole ticks, we
focused on the microbiomes within two speciﬁc tissues
in adult female ticks, salivary glands and the midgut,
as these are important for maintenance and transmis-
sion of many tick-borne pathogens associated with
I. scapularis (Spielman et al. Based on Illumina’s protocol and the out-
comes of preliminary PCR optimization procedures, the
thermal cycling conditions consisted of an initial denat-
uration at 98 °C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles of
98 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 30 s, fol-
lowed by a ﬁnal extension for 5 min at 72 °C on a
Techne Prime Elite Thermal Cycler (Bibby Scientiﬁc). phylogenetically

informed weighted

b-Diversity was calculated using jackkniﬁng (use of
subsets of available data) at a rarefaction depth of
100 000 sequences for developmental stage categories
and a depth of 200 000 for whole adult females and
their organs in QIIME. When abundance was taken into account with the
weighted UniFrac distances , the midguts and
whole female ticks tended to cluster together, away
from the more divergent salivary gland samples, pre-
sumably due to the >98% relative abundance of Rick-
ettsia species in these two sample types.
