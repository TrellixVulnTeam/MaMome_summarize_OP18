Data processing is considered to be the step necessary for
converting the raw data, such as metagenomics sequence reads,
into biologically meaningful representations, such as OTU counts
using bioinformatics tools, some of which are done in the
sequencing device itself. These quantities cannot be
compared directly across multiple samples. Although several pipelines provide this functionality,
it has been found inadmissible for metagenomics microbiome
studies as it discards many reads leading to decreased sensitivity
in diﬀerential abundance testing (McMurdie and Holmes, 2014)
and biased estimates for alpha diversity (Willis, 2019). Computational Diet, Microbiome and Health

TABLE 3 | Key challenges that arise in microbiome data analysis with examples and suggested solutions. High dimensionality:
Metagenomic data processing results in many entities such
as genes and species discovered for each sample, which
may not be shared among multiple samples. Solutions: (I) Use dimensionality reduction such as PCA prior to regression. ( Example: In one case, metagenomic data processing from marker-gene data has provided us with
relative abundances at the genus level, but we do not know the possible functions of the microbiota
in terms of proteins that it can produce. increases, the chance of false discoveries also increases. Non-parametric tests are
good alternatives when the assumptions regarding the data
being normally distributed do not hold. In a diﬀerent
study, the classiﬁcation task was to identify healthy vs. unhealthy
donors given relative OTU abundance data (including species
level) coming from shotgun metagenomics sequencing of the gut
(as well as other body sites) (Pasolli et al., RF achieves this using an
ensemble-based technique where the prediction is made based on
predictions from many trained classiﬁers. We expect the development of new
classiﬁcation methods that can deal with the aforementioned
challenges arising in DGMH data by considering the biological
instruments, and
phenomenon, properties of measurement
upstream data processing pipelines. analytics

Unsupervised Learning Methods
Dimensionality reduction
High-dimensional datasets can provide a high resolution and
multifaceted view of a phenomenon such as gut microbiota. In another study, the top ﬁve PCs
of individual bacteria’s genome (sequenced from infant fecal
samples) were used to create a classiﬁer for predicting antibiotic
resistance (Rahman et al., Multiple factor analysis (MFA)
is an extension of PCA that considers predeﬁned grouping of
features during DR to ensure equal representation for all groups

of features in derived PCs (Abdi et al., Factors that are identiﬁed
by EFA are uncorrelated to each other similar to PCs in
PCA; however, PCs are used to explain overall variance instead
of correlations. For example, PCoA was applied given UniFrac distances
between OTU abundances (from 16S rRNA samples) from
the gut microbiota of donors (Yatsunenko et al., When unknown, the number that provides higher cluster
scoring is picked. 2018; Bauer and Thiele,
2018; Greenhalgh et al., In cases where most users only have evaluated a few
items, most of the matrix remains empty. The
second challenge is the curse of dimensionality. In scenario B, the goal is to provide
recommended probiotic intake for supporting a healthy gut
