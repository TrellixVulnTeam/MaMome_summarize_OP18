the commonality that relates both BV and vaginal pH to HPV
infection (independent of HIV) is the RA of certain Lactobacil-
lus species, most notably L. crispatus. The number of clusters was determined by the Milligan
point-biserial criterion  The Shannon diversity index
(SDI) was calculated for the microbiome at each patient visit
in the data set 

The primary outcomes were detection of any HPV and
any oncogenic HPV. Selected Characteristics of Participants in the Cervicovaginal Microbiota Substudy at their Index Visit, Stratified by Study Group

. . . example, Candida albicans growth in vitro was inhibited via
modulation of Toll-like receptors 2/4 by L. crispatus in epithe-
lial cell culture 

While the current study contributes data suggesting a possi-
ble protective effect of L. crispatus against cervicovaginal HPV
infection in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected women (inde-
pendent of pH), several limitations need to be considered. In summary, our results suggest a beneﬁcial effect of L. crisp-
atus on the burden of HPV in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected
women that is unrelated to pH. Further research to better un-
derstand these relationships is strongly warranted, including
large prospective cohort studies and laboratory research to un-
derstand the mechanisms that underlie the relation of the cer-
vicovaginal microbiota with HPV infection.
