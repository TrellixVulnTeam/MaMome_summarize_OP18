Oliver et al. The infant metabolome for saliva and urine
had little variance attributed to which subject donated the sample, but GC-TOF MS was
able to detect a signiﬁcant change between the infant urine metabolome at birth
versus 6 and 12 months of age (PERMANOVA; R2 (cid:2) 34%; P (cid:2) 0.0007; Table S2). Mantel tests to determine if intersample relationships were similar
between chromatography methods (including both GC-TOF MS and lipidomics)
showed a strong correlation between saliva samples and weaker correlations between
urine and CVF (Table S3). Studies have pointed out
Gardnerella’s preference for ammonia as a nitrogen source  moreover, this ability to
assimilate ammonia and produce amino acids has been implicated in mutualistic
interactions between species of Prevotella, in the context of BV  Together, these
BV-associated organisms contribute to genital inﬂammation, which may play a role in
the susceptibility of certain diseases, such as HIV 

Increased abundance of mannitol when L. crispatus was present is an important and
unexpected ﬁnding . Strikingly, the ability of lipidomics to differentiate mothers from

Oliver et al. To amplify the V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, 10 ng of DNA
template was combined with PCR master mix (0.2 mM deoxynucleoside triphosphate [dNTP] mix,
0.56 mg/ml bovine serum albumin [BSA], 0.4 (cid:2)M Illumina adapter sequence-tagged forward primer
 and 0.025 U/(cid:2)l Taq DNA polymerase) and 0.4-(cid:2)M barcode-tagged reverse primers and
then ampliﬁed in triplicate 25-(cid:2)l reactions, along with a no-template control, for 30 cycles (98°C for
2 min; 98°C for 20 sec, 50°C for 30 sec, and 72°C for 45 sec; repeat steps 2 to 4 29 times; 72°C for 10 min).
