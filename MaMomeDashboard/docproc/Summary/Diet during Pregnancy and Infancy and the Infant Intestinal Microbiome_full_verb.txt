Trial enrolled 881 pregnant women at 3 clinical sites in the US
(Boston, Massachusetts; St. Louis, Missouri; and San Diego,
California). Inclusion criteria included a personal history of
asthma or allergy in the pregnant woman or in the father of
the fetus. Stool samples were collected
from infants between age 3 and 6 months. The only exclusion criterion
for stool collection was antibiotic use by the infant in the prior
7 days. The top principal component was used
in regression models. Questions regarding the child diet were asked beginning at
age 6 months. Covariates in multivariable analysis, chosen on the
basis of prior studies,7,11 included mode of delivery, child race/
ethnicity (African American, Hispanic, white, other), age at stool
collection, treatment arm, and maternal education. P values of .05 or less indicated signiﬁ-
cance. Missing data
were considered missing at random and complete case analy-
sis was employed. Analysis covariates were the same
as for multivariable regression analyses described above, and
results were considered signiﬁcant at a false discovery rate of
.05 or less. Infants who were
breastfed had mothers with higher educational levels (P < .001)
and higher household incomes (P < .001). We analyzed maternal diet as the ﬁrst principal compo-
nent of the maternal food frequency questionnaire responses,
which represented high intake of vegetables and low intake of
processed meats and deep fried foods (Tables II and III; avail-
able at www.jpeds.com). *Numbers do not add to 323 because of missing infant diet data. In analyses of genera
selected a priori for analysis, adjusted for demographic factors,
we observed signiﬁcantly higher relative abundances of
Biﬁdobacterium spp (mean difference 0.51; P = .02), Lactoba-
cillus spp (mean difference 3.87; P < .001), and Clostridium spp
(mean difference 0.75; P = .05) among breastfed vs formula-
fed infants. Results were similar after adding solid foods and
maternal diet as covariates to the adjusted model. After adjusting for de-
mographic variables, solid food introduction was positively as-
sociated with Clostridium spp (mean difference = 0.80 log
counts; P = .03) and this association remained signiﬁcant after
addition of infant breastfeeding vs formula feeding status and
maternal diet to the adjusted model (mean difference = 0.75
log counts, P = .05). We next asked whether race/ethnicity inﬂuenced the
association between the infant’s diet and the intestinal
microbiome by including an interaction term between race/
ethnicity and breast milk vs formula in models adjusted for
demographic and other dietary variables. We found that
Biﬁdobacterium spp counts were similar among breastfed and
formula-fed African American infants, and Hispanic and white
breastfed infants had higher levels of Biﬁdobacterium spp com-
pared with formula-fed Hispanic and White infants (African

Significant (P <.05) results are in bold. Mean, SD for normally distributed variables (Shannon index, Richness). §Dietary variables: infant breastfeeding vs formula feeding and first principal component of maternal diet (high in vegetables and low in processed meats and deep fried foods). Results shown for negative binomial regression analyses. In an ethnically homogeneous population using targeted
quantitative polymerase chain reaction on stool samples col-
lected at age 1 month, Penders et al showed breastfed infants
had less Clostridia difﬁcile compared with formula-fed infants.7,30
This contrasts with our ﬁnding of a positive association between
breastfeeding and overall Clostridia spp, though we expect that
the inﬂuence of breastfeeding differs among individual species
within this genus. Consistent with our results, breastfeeding
is thought to increase Biﬁdobacterium spp. If conﬁrmed, this relation-
ship may suggest early genetic inﬂuences or other unmeasured
factors in the response of the microbiome to the diet in dif-
ferent ethnic groups. ■
