Lactin-V to Prevent Recurrence of Bacterial Vaginosis

Bacterial vaginosis affects 15 to 50% 

of women of reproductive age worldwide.1 
After treatment with an antibiotic agent, 
20  to  75%  of  women  have  recurrent  bacterial 
vaginosis within 3 months.2 Bacterial vaginosis 
has  been  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of 
sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including 
human  immunodeficiency  virus  (HIV)  infec-
tion,3-6  as  well  as  premature  birth7,8  and  other 
reproductive  health  sequelae.9,10  Furthermore, 
recurrent  bacterial  vaginosis  leads  to  negative 
emotional, sexual, and social effects, as well as 
a  substantial  economic  burden  on  the  health 
care system.11,12 The high incidence of recurrence 
suggests  the  need  for  new  agents  to  prevent 
bacterial vaginosis.

Lactobacillus crispatus  CTV-05  (Lactin-V,  Osel) 
is  a  live  biotherapeutic  product  that  contains  a 
naturally occurring vaginal strain of L. crispatus. 
It  is  composed  of  a  powder  containing  2×109 
colony-forming units (CFU) of L. crispatus CTV-05 
preserved  with  inactive  ingredients  and  is  ad-
ministered  with  the  use  of  a  prefilled  vaginal 
applicator.  Lactin-V  is  designed  to  promote  a 
community  state  type  (i.e.,  microbial  composi-
tion) with a predominance of  L. crispatus11 after 
treatment with vaginal 0.75% metronidazole gel. 
In previous clinical trials, no serious or grade 3 
adverse events that were considered to be related 
to the use of Lactin-V were reported.13-18 On the 
basis of the results from a phase 2a clinical trial 
of Lactin-V,16 the current phase 2b trial was de-
signed to assess whether treatment with Lactin-V 
after  a  5-day  course  of  metronidazole  to  treat 
bacterial vaginosis would result in a significantly 
lower  incidence  of  recurrence  of  bacterial  vagi-
nosis than placebo.

Trial Design and Oversight
From  April  2016  through  February  2019,  we 
conducted  a  multicenter,  randomized,  double-
blind,  placebo-controlled,  phase  2b  trial  to  as-
sess  the  efficacy  of  repeated  doses  of  Lactin-V 
over  the  course  of  11  weeks  in  preventing  the 
recurrence of bacterial vaginosis in women who 
had received a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis at 
the screening visit. The trial protocol and statis-
tical analysis plan are available with the full text 

of this article at NEJM.org. The protocol, which 
was  approved  by  the  institutional  review  board 
at each of four participating clinical sites, was 
written by the trial investigators and personnel 
at  Emmes  (a  contract  research  organization). 
Representatives of the Division of Microbiology 
and  Infectious  Diseases,  National  Institute  of 
Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National 
Institutes  of  Health  (NIH)  reviewed  the  proto-
col. Staff members at Osel reviewed the portions 
of the protocol that described Lactin-V and pla-
cebo,  including  storage  requirements,  and  one 
of  the  staff  members  (the  penultimate  author) 
was involved in writing the manuscript. Osel also 
provided  both  Lactin-V  and  placebo.  The  first, 
second, and last authors vouch for the complete-
ness and accuracy of the data and for the fidel-
ity of the trial to the protocol.

Premenopausal women 18 to 45 years of age 
were screened for eligibility after providing writ-
ten  informed  consent  to  be  screened.  At  the 
screening visit, the participant’s medical history 
was obtained, and physical and pelvic examina-
tions  were  performed.  If  a  potentially  eligible 
woman met at least three of four Amsel criteria 
(i.e.,  thin,  white  or  yellow,  homogeneous  dis-
charge;  >20%  clue  cells  on  microscopic  exami-
nation; vaginal fluid with a pH of >4.5; and re-
lease  of  a  fishy  odor  when  10%  potassium 
hydroxide  is  added  to  a  vaginal  specimen),  a 
vaginal swab was obtained and sent to a central 
laboratory at Magee–Womens Research Institute. 
Gram’s staining of the vaginal smear was used 
to determine the Nugent score (0 to 3 [normal], 
4  to  6  [intermediate],  or  7  to  10  [indicative  of 
bacterial  vaginosis]).19  A  blood  sample  was  ob-
tained to test for HIV infection and syphilis; a 
vaginal swab was obtained for molecular testing 
for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomonas in-
fections; and a urine specimen was obtained to 
test for beta human chorionic gonadotropin and 
urinary tract infection. Potentially eligible wom-
en completed a standard 5-day course of vaginal 
0.75% metronidazole within 30 days before the 
screening visit.

Eligible women who met at least three Amsel 
criteria and who had a Nugent score of 4 to 10 at 
the screening visit and negative results on tests 
for STIs then returned to the trial clinic within 
48 hours after completion of the metronidazole

regimen for reevaluation of their eligibility. After 
providing written informed consent to partici-
pate in the trial, eligible women were randomly 
assigned,  in  a  2:1  ratio,  to  receive  Lactin-V  at 
2×109  CFU  per  dose  or  matching  placebo  and 
subsequently  received  a  carton  containing  25 
vaginal applicators. The placebo formulation con-
tained the same inactive ingredients as Lactin-V, 
without L. crispatus CTV-05.

Participants  were  instructed  on  proper  ad-
ministration of the assigned treatment and were 
observed during administration of the first dose 
in the clinic. Subsequently, participants were to 
administer four consecutive daily doses of Lactin-V 
or  placebo  during  week  1,  followed  by  twice-
weekly doses for 10 weeks. Participants used a 
paper-based  memory  aid  to  log  administration 
of  Lactin-V  or  placebo  and  menstruation  and 
sexual activity and to record symptoms and ad-
verse  events.  The  memory  aid  was  to  be  com-
pleted  daily  during  the  first  12  weeks  of  the 
trial and weekly thereafter.

Clinic follow-up visits were scheduled 4, 8, 12, 
and  24  weeks  after  enrollment.  At  each  time 
point,  vaginal  swabs  were  obtained  for  assess-
ment  of  Amsel  criteria,  determination  of  the 
Nugent  score,  and  detection  of  L. crispatus  (all 
strains  and  the  CTV-05  strain  specifically)  by 
means of quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction 
(PCR) assays; the swabs were also used for re-
peat STI testing if clinically indicated. A positive 
L. crispatus result was defined as a level above the 
lower limit of detection for both the assay for all 
strains and the assay for the CTV-05 strain (see 
the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM 
.org,  for  details  of  the  PCR  methods).  Vaginal 
applicators  that  were  returned  at  the  follow-up 
visits  were  stained  with  0.5%  trypan  blue  as  a 
proxy for adherence to the assigned treatment.20 
Further details of the trial, including trial proce-
dures and the complete list of eligibility criteria, 
are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.

Treatment Assignment
Women  underwent  randomization  after  com-
pletion  of  the  course  of  metronidazole.  Ran-
domization was performed in permuted blocks 
with the use of the online enrollment module 
of  AdvantageEDC  software  (Emmes).  The  ran-
domization sequence was prepared by statisti-
cians at Emmes.

At  the  time  of  randomization,  a  kit  number 
was generated electronically, and the site phar-
macist selected the corresponding carton con-
taining  either  Lactin-V  or  matching  placebo. 
Trial personnel and participants were unaware 
of  the  treatment-group  assignment.  Before  un-
blinding of the treatment-group assignments oc-
curred, a case-review committee identified par-
ticipants who had had protocol deviations, such 
as the use of prohibited medications, trial visits 
outside  the  protocol-specified  time  window,  or 
poor adherence to the assigned treatment; these 
participants were excluded from the per-protocol 
analyses (see the Methods section in the Supple-
mentary Appendix).

Efficacy Outcomes
The primary efficacy outcome was the percent-
age of participants who had recurrent bacterial 
vaginosis  (defined  by  the  presence  of  at  least 
three Amsel criteria and a Nugent score of 4 to 
10) at any follow-up visit up to and including the 
week  12  visit.  Prespecified  secondary  efficacy 
outcomes  included  the  percentage  of  partici-
pants who had recurrent bacterial vaginosis at 
any follow-up visit up to and including the week 
24  visit,  after  completion  of  the  12-week  post-
treatment  phase  of  the  trial;  the  percentage  of 
participants in the Lactin-V group who had de-
tectable L. crispatus CTV-05 at 12 weeks and at 24 
weeks,  overall  and  stratified  according  to  the 
occurrence of menses and of sexual intercourse; 
and the acceptability of Lactin-V, as assessed by 
the percentage of participants in each treatment 
group who were adherent to the assigned treat-
ment and by responses on questionnaires. (The 
data from the questionnaire are not reported here.)

Safety Outcomes
Participants recorded the presence and intensity 
of  solicited  (expected  and  prespecified)  local 
(involving the genitourinary tract) and systemic 
adverse events in a memory aid, starting on the 
first day of dosing, daily through week 12, and 
then  weekly  through  week  24.  In  addition,  at 
each  trial  visit,  participants  were  asked  about 
any other (unsolicited) adverse events. The lists 
of solicited local and systemic adverse events can 
be found in the protocol. The severity of all ad-
verse  events  was  graded  according  to  grading 
tables  provided  by  the  Division  of  AIDS  of  the

NIH.21,22  The  percentage  of  participants  who 
discontinued Lactin-V or placebo early owing to 
adverse events was also evaluated.

The primary safety outcome was the percent-
age of participants who had at least one adverse 
event by week 24 that was considered to be re-
lated to Lactin-V or placebo. All solicited adverse 
events were considered to be related to Lactin-V 
or placebo; the relatedness of unsolicited adverse 
events was determined by trial staff.

Statistical Analysis
The efficacy analyses were performed in several 
analysis populations. The intention-to-treat analy-
ses  included  all  participants  who  underwent 
randomization. The modified intention-to-treat, 
complete-case-analysis,  and  per-protocol  popu-
lations are described in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix.

We estimated that with a sample of 228 par-
ticipants,  the  trial  would  have  70%  power  to 
detect  a  cumulative  percentage  of  participants 
with  recurrence  of  bacterial  vaginosis  by  week 
12  that  was  50%  lower  in  the  Lactin-V  group 
than in the placebo group, using Pearson’s chi-
square test at a two-sided alpha level. This cal-
culation  was  based  on  an  anticipated  dropout 
rate of 10% in the complete-case-analysis popu-
lation and an assumed cumulative percentage of 
participants  in  the  placebo  group  with  recur-
rence of bacterial vaginosis by week 12 of 30%.
We  calculated  the  cumulative  percentage  of 
participants  who  had  a  recurrence  of  bacterial 
vaginosis  by  the  12-week  and  24-week  visits  in 
each treatment group, as well as the risk ratios 
and  95%  confidence  intervals.  Pearson’s  chi-
square test was used to test the null hypothesis 
that the cumulative percentages of participants 
who  had  recurrence  of  bacterial  vaginosis  by 
weeks 12 and 24 in the Lactin-V group would be 
equal to those in the placebo group, with a two-
sided  alternative  hypothesis.  For  the  intention-
to-treat  and  modified  intention-to-treat  analy-
ses, when diagnoses of bacterial vaginosis were 
missing, the data were imputed with the use of 
two  single-imputation  methods,  one  of  which 
was the last observation carried forward. Post 
hoc  sensitivity  analyses  for  missing  data  were 
performed  to  calculate  risk  ratios  and  corre-
sponding  confidence  intervals;  the  hypothesis 
tests  were  performed  with  the  use  of  logistic-

regression  multiple  imputation,  under  the  as-
sumption  of  a  monotone  pattern  of  missing 
data.23,24 The results of the prespecified inten-
tion-to-treat  analyses  in  which  missing  data 
were  imputed  with  the  use  of  the  last-observa-
tion-carried-forward  method  were  included  in 
the final clinical trial report and were reported 
to ClinicalTrials.gov. Here, we present the results 
of  the  post  hoc  multiple-imputation  analyses, 
which corroborated the last-observation-carried-
forward analyses; the results of the latter analy-
ses are included in Tables S1 and S2.

The percentage of participants in each group 
who had detectable L. crispatus species (any strain) 
and L. crispatus CTV-05 at any time after baseline 
through week 24 were calculated, along with risk 
ratios  for  these  outcomes.  For  the  intention-to-
treat  and  modified  intention-to-treat  analyses, 
missing  data  regarding  the  concentrations  of 
L.  crispatus  species  and  L. crispatus  CTV-05  were 
not  imputed.  In  addition,  the  associations  of 
adherence  to  the  assigned  treatment  (≥75%  of 
doses administered vs. <75% of doses adminis-
tered), reported occurrence of menses since the 
last  visit  (menses  vs.  no  menses),  and  reported 
occurrence of sexual activity (sex without the use 
of a condom vs. abstinence or sex with the use of 
a condom) with the presence of L. crispatus spe-
cies and L. crispatus CTV-05 were assessed as ex-
ploratory analyses, as specified in the statistical 
analysis plan.

Because  the  statistical  analysis  plan  did  not 
include a provision for correcting for multiplicity 
for the secondary or other outcomes, results are 
reported as point estimates and 95% confidence 
intervals.  The  widths  of  the  confidence  inter-
vals  were  not  adjusted  for  multiplicity,  so  the 
intervals should not be used to infer definitive 
treatment  effects  for  the  secondary  or  other 
outcomes.

One participant in the Lactin-V group did not 
receive any doses, and Lactin-V was discontinued 
in 2 participants in the Lactin-V group who had 
spontaneous abortions (both of which were cat-
egorized as unsolicited adverse events). In addi-
tion, the assigned treatment was discontinued 
in 2 participants in the Lactin-V group and in 
2  participants  in  the  placebo  group  owing  to 
genital itching or burning. Adherence to the as-
signed treatment was 81% according to partici-

terial vaginosis was known for 197 participants 
 In the intention-to-treat population, re-
currence  of  bacterial  vaginosis  by  week  12  oc-
curred in 46 participants in the Lactin-V

Secondary Outcomes
Among  the  participants  without  known  recur-
rence of bacterial vaginosis by week 12, a total 
of 13 of 106 participants in the Lactin-V 
group and 7 of 42 participants in the pla-
cebo  group  had  a  recurrence  by  week  24.  The 
risk  ratio  for  recurrence  by  week  24  was  0.73 
 The recurrence 
status at week 24 was unknown for 30 partici-
pants   in  the  Lactin-V  group  and  for  14 
participants in the placebo group. Results 
across the analysis populations were consistent 
(Table S2).

In the Lactin-V group, L. crispatus CTV-05 was 
detected in 79% (at week 12) to 84% of partici-
pants during weeks 4, 8, and 12 and in 48% of 
participants at week 24 . In contrast, in 
the  placebo  group,  L. crispatus  CTV-05  was  de-
tected in 2 to 6% of participants during weeks 4, 
8, and 12 and in 2% of participants at week 24. 
The  results  were  materially  unchanged  across 
the  analysis  populations.  Among  the  partici-
pants  with  detectable  L.  crispatus  CTV-05,  the 
median  concentration  in  the  Lactin-V  group 
ranged from 1.7×106 to 6.2×106 CFU per millili-
ter during the treatment phase through week 12

or  occurrence  of  sex  without  the  use  of  a  con-
dom. The incidence and risk ratio for each vari-
able are provided in Table S3.

Safety
After the exclusion of 1 participant in the Lactin-V 
group who did not receive any doses, 151 par-
ticipants  in  the  Lactin-V  group  and  76  partici-
pants  in  the  placebo  group  were  evaluated  for 
safety;  data  on  solicited  adverse  events  were 
missing for 11 and 10 participants, respectively, 
owing to early loss to follow-up. The percentage 
of participants who had at least one treatment-
related  adverse  event  (i.e.,  any  solicited  adverse 
event  or  an  unsolicited  adverse  event  that  was 
assessed  by  the  trial  staff  as  being  related  to 
Lactin-V  or  placebo)  by  week  24  did  not  differ 
significantly  between  the  groups  (132  partici-
pants in the Lactin-V group and 60 par-
ticipants in the placebo group; risk ratio, 
1.11; 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.33; P = 0.12).

Across  the  two  treatment  groups,  the  most 
common solicited local adverse events were ab-
normal vaginal discharge, abnormal vaginal odor, 
external  genital  irritation,  and  genital  itching 
,  and  the  most  common  solicited  sys-
temic  adverse  events  were  abdominal  pain  or 
cramps,  headache,  and  frequent  urination.  In 
general,  the  incidence  and  severity  of  solicited 
local and systemic adverse events were similar in 
the two groups (Tables S4 through S6).

Unsolicited  adverse  events  were  reported  in 
63 participants in the Lactin-V group and 
in  22  participants   in  the  placebo  group 
(risk ratio, 1.44; 95% CI, 0.97 to 2.30) (Tables S7 
and S8). A total of 7 participants (4 in the Lactin-
V group and 3 in the placebo group) had a severe 
grade 3 adverse event, one of which was reported 
as a serious adverse event (Lactin-V group) (Ta-
ble S9). None of the severe adverse events were 
classified as being related to Lactin-V or placebo.

Discussion

The use of Lactin-V after treatment with vaginal 
metronidazole for bacterial vaginosis resulted in 
a significantly lower incidence of recurrence of 
bacterial  vaginosis  at  12  weeks  than  placebo, 
and  the  benefit  appeared  to  persist  through 
week  24.  Overall,  adherence  to  the  assigned 
treatment  was  high.  In  the  Lactin-V  group, 
L. crispatus CTV-05 was detected in almost 80% 
of  the  participants  at  the  week  12  visit  and  in 
almost  50%  of  the  participants  at  the  week  24 
visit after completion of the 12-week post-treat-
ment phase of the trial.

In  addition  to  live  biotherapeutic  products 
such  as  Lactin-V,  other  products  and  strategies 
have been tested to determine their effectiveness 
in  reducing  the  risk  of  recurrence  of  bacterial 
vaginosis; these include intravaginal metronida-
zole  at  a  dose  of  750  mg  plus  miconazole  at  a 
dose of 200 mg,25 boric acid,26 and, most recently, 
vaginal microbiome transplantation.27 Although 
combination  metronidazole–probiotic  regimens 
have been tested previously and some have been 
shown to reduce the risk of recurrence of bacte-
rial  vaginosis,  the  trials  have  generally  been 
small  and  have  lacked  the  use  of  standardized 
methods, including objective outcome measures 
for bacterial vaginosis recurrence and coloniza-
tion by the active trial medication.28-30

We  found  no  material  differences  between 
the treatment groups in the percentage of par-
ticipants  who  had  a  treatment-related  adverse 
event or in the number, type, or severity of solic-
ited local adverse events during the course of the

24  weeks  of  follow-up.  These  results  extend 
earlier findings seen with Lactin-V and support 
the general safety of the current formulation and 
dosing strategy.16

The  results  of  our  phase  2a  trial  raised  the 
possibility  that  exposure  to  semen  during  sex 
without  the  use  of  a  condom,  the  presence  of 
menstrual blood, and the reestablishment of bac-
teria  associated  with  bacterial  vaginosis  soon 
after completion of antibiotic treatment may re-
duce the colonization of L. crispatus after admin-
istration of Lactin-V.16,31 In the current trial, the 
initial dose of Lactin-V or placebo was adminis-
tered  within  48  hours  after  the  last  dose  of 
vaginal metronidazole gel, and the frequency of 
dosing after the first week was increased from 
once  weekly  to  twice  weekly  through  week  11. 
We did not find that the occurrence of menses 
since the last visit or the occurrence of sex with-
out the use of a condom affected the detection 
of L. crispatus CTV-05.

Among the enrolled women, 14% were ineli-
gible for the analysis of the primary outcome, a 

percentage  that  was  higher  than  the  assumed 
percentage of 10% that was used to estimate the 
sample  size.  However,  the  results  of  multiple-
imputation analyses and several sensitivity analy-
ses  yielded  findings  that  were  consistent  with 
those of the complete-case analysis. The current 
trial  evaluated  11  weeks  of  treatment  and  24 
weeks of follow-up; further study should be con-
sidered  to  assess  longer-term  sustainability  of 
colonization and prevention of bacterial vaginosis.
Among  women  with  a  history  of  bacterial 
vaginosis,  the  use  of  Lactin-V  after  treatment 
with vaginal metronidazole resulted in a lower 
incidence of recurrence of bacterial vaginosis at 
12 weeks than placebo.
