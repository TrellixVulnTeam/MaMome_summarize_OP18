Microbiota and Female Sex Hormones

which has been widely investigated during menopause.
Here, we consider menopause or the menopausal phase,
including perimenopause (before menopause), menopause and
postmenopause (after menopause).

Considering that menopause can last

for approximately
30 years of a woman’s life (Brotman et al., 2014), the purpose
of this mini-review is to highlight the importance of alterations
in the oral and gut microbiota during estrogen deﬁciency and
determine their relevance in oral infections and inﬂammatory
diseases that are associated with menopause.

HORMONES

the cheeks,

The oral cavity (mouth) is composed of several distinct microbial
habitats, including the lips, the teeth, the gingival sulcus, the
the palate and the tonsils, which are
tongue,
colonized by hundreds of diﬀerent bacterial, viral, and fungal
species (Dewhirst et al., 2010; Yost et al., 2015). The microbial
communities associated with these structures are in symbiosis
with the host (Sanz et al., 2017). However, in the presence
of stressors that can perturb this homeostasis, several oral
infectious diseases may appear,
including dental caries and
periodontitis (Almstahl et al., 2010; Dewhirst et al., 2010). Many
of these disease are recognized to be caused by the consortia of
organisms in a bioﬁlm rather than a single pathogen (Jenkinson
and Lamont, 2005). In addition, poor oral health and oral
diseases may be associated with many systemic diseases (Seymour
et al., 2007), such as cardiovascular diseases (Joshipura et al.,
1996; Montebugnoli et al., 2004; Belenguer et al., 2006), stroke
(Joshipura et al., 2003), preterm birth (Oﬀenbacher et al., 1998),
diabetes (Genco et al., 2005), and pneumonia (Awano et al.,
2008).

Fusobacterium,

In healthy individuals, the microorganisms found in the
mouth with the largest representation include Streptococcus,
Actinomyces, Veillonella,
Porphyromonas,
Prevotella, Treponema, Neisseria, Haemophilus, Eubacteria,
Leptotrichia,
Lactobacterium,
Eikenella,
Peptostreptococcus,
and Propionibacterium
(Jenkinson and Lamont, 2005; Liu et al., 2012). The behavior of
these organisms can be very dynamic and adapt to a wide range
of environments and interactions with other microbial species
while aggregated in bioﬁlms over the oral surfaces.

Capnocytophaga,
Staphylococcus,

Estrogen receptor-beta has been detected in the oral mucosa
and salivary glands (Valimaa et al., 2004), and some evidence
shows age-related hormonal changes in the exfoliated normal
buccal mucosa of women (Donald et al., 2013). Moreover, the
vaginal and buccal epithelia share some microscopic similarities.
As observed by Thompson et al.  the patterns of surface
keratinization and the distribution and appearance of
the
lipid lamellae in the intercellular spaces were similar between
vaginal and buccal epithelial samples of postmenopausal women.
Therefore, given that many menopausal women also suﬀer from
oral discomforts in addition to climacteric symptoms (Meurman
et al., 2009), an understanding of the impact of female sex

hormones on the characteristics of the oral microbiota may be
clinically relevant, especially during menopause. Some of the
main complaints from women in menopause include dry mouth
and tooth loss, and the existing data have focused on the salivary
microbial composition and the microbiota characteristics of the
gingival sulcus. Therefore, this review will explore the main
ﬁndings of the relationship between the oral microbiota and
menopause in saliva and periodontal support.

Saliva
Saliva plays an important role in the maintenance of oral health
integrity and the protection against dental caries and other oral
diseases (Marsh et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016). The salivary
microbiota is highly diverse and complex (Curtis et al., 2011).

Estrogen and menopause-related hormonal imbalances are
believed to aﬀect oral health (Cao et al., 2007). According to
the literature (Meurman et al., 2009), together with climacteric
complaints, various oral discomforts are reported in menopausal
women. The main peri- and postmenopausal symptoms include
xerostomia (subjective oral dryness) and/or hyposalivation
(Mahesh et al., 2014), which may increase the occurrence of
mucosal and dental diseases, such as candidiasis. Few studies
have investigated the eﬀects of hormone replacement therapy in
such patients (Mahesh et al., 2014; Lago et al., 2015), although
the existing results show an improvement in symptoms following
such treatment (Mahesh et al., 2014; Lago et al., 2015).

The quantitative and qualitative changes in saliva may alter
the regular homeostasis of oral health, subsequently leading to
speciﬁc changes in the salivary bacterial composition (Nasidze
et al., 2009, 2011; Belstrøm et al., 2014). However, recent
ﬁndings have shown that patients with severe hyposalivation do
not diﬀer in their bacterial proﬁles compared with those with
normal salivary ﬂow rates (Belstrom et al., 2016), although the
corresponding study did not focus on the evaluation of such
diﬀerences between menopausal and non-menopausal women.

Because the salivary composition may be inﬂuenced by the
presence of oral diseases, prescribed medications and general
health (Belstrom et al., 2016), researchers must pay attention
to the sample size and control for confounding factors when
revising the existing literature to conﬁrm the external validity
of any quantitative and qualitative changes in saliva related to
menopause.

Periodontal Support
The periodontium is the specialized tissue that both surrounds
and supports the teeth. Periodontal disease, which includes
gingivitis and periodontitis, is highly prevalent in adults, and
disease severity increases with age. This inﬂammatory disease
develops over time with the accumulation of bioﬁlm (dental
plaque), bacterial dysbiosis, the formation of periodontal pockets,
gum recession, and tissue destruction (including alveolar bone
loss), which can ultimately lead to tooth loss (Michaud et al.,
2017).

Fluctuating female sexual hormone levels in menopausal
women may represent key factors that respond to changes
detected in the oral cavity (Dutt et al., 2013). Menopause
is accompanied by decreased bone density, which may have

implications for oral health such as the risk of enhanced
progression of periodontal infections and tooth loss (Hernandez-
Vigueras et al., 2016). According to the literature, sex-related
hormonal changes may cause the gums to become more
susceptible to plaque and create a much higher risk for gingivitis
and advanced periodontitis (Suresh and Radfar, 2004).

Periodontitis is a chronic inﬂammatory process that occurs
in response to an increase in Gram-negative bacteria in the
bioﬁlm (Ruby and Barbeau, 2002), aﬀecting the tissues that
surround and support the teeth. Speciﬁc bacterial species, such
as Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythensis, were
found to be important
in the etiology of periodontitis in
postmenopausal women (Brennan et al., 2007). In addition,
changes in periodontal status were found to be associated
with variations in sex hormone levels (Mascarenhas et al.,
2003), and the occurrence of periodontitis was reported to be
greater in postmenopausal women who did not receive hormone
replacement than in premenopausal women (Haas et al., 2009).
Therefore, from a clinical point of view, the roles of sex hormones
and hormone therapy in the prevalence of subgingival bacterial
infection in peri- and postmenopausal women are of great
interest.

In a cohort study that included 106 women aged 50–58 years,
hormone replacement therapy led to a decreased number of
positive samples showing the periodontal pathogens P. gingivalis,
Prevotella intermedia, and T.
forsythia from the subgingival
plaque (Tarkkila et al., 2010). Consistent with this result, a
previous study found improved periodontal probing depths and
tooth mobility in 190 randomized women who received hormone
therapy for 1 year (López-Marcos et al., 2005). Conversely,
Pilgram et al. investigated 135 women in a randomized,
controlled trial who received estrogen replacement for 3 years
and did not ﬁnd any changes in clinical parameters such as the
attachment of teeth or the bone mineral density of the lumbar
spine. In mice, estrogen seems to modulate IL-1 production
and participate in the resistance of females to disseminating
dentoalveolar infections, leading to the enhanced localization
of these infections (Youssef and Stashenko, 2017), which draws
attention to the potential role of sex-related hormones in the
modulation of oral mucosal infections.

Non-conventional treatment approaches for oral infections,
with a particular emphasis on dental bioﬁlm-related diseases,
have gained attention in recent years. The use of probiotics
and prebiotics to improve gastrointestinal health has now led
to an interest in using these treatments to control oral diseases
(Allaker and Ian Douglas, 2015). However, few studies have
focused on recovery of the oral equilibrium by promoting
beneﬁcial microbiota. Despite diﬀerences in the composition
of the gut and oral microbiota, the community types observed
in the gut are predictive of the community observed in the
mouth and vice versa (Ding and Schloss, 2014). Among other
host factors, the oral microbiota serves as an inoculum for the
intestine, and the microorganisms that ﬁnd adequate conditions
in the mouth give rise to distinct types of communities in
the intestine. Interestingly, oral inoculation with P. gingivalis
in experimental models leads to a change in the intestinal
microbiota, which is a possible mechanism for the establishment

of diseases associated with periodontitis, such as cardiovascular
diseases (Arimatsu et al., 2014). In this sense, understanding the
role of health-associated microorganisms may have utility in the
application of these approaches for the prevention and treatment
of disease (Sanz et al., 2017).

THE INTERACTION BETWEEN GUT
MICROBIOTA AND FEMALE SEX
HORMONES

As mentioned earlier, female sex hormones levels inﬂuence
the composition of the microbiota in many sites of the body,
especially the gut. Due to intimate contact with the larger gut
immune system, the gut microbiota has been shown to inﬂuence
many diseases outside of this organ (Figure 1). Accordingly,
imbalance of the gut microbiota, called dysbiosis, has been
extensively related to metabolic and immunological diseases.
Interestingly, the presence or absence of estrogen may be able
to alter the gut microbiota equilibrium and corresponding
disease pathways. Some autoimmune diseases aﬀect more often
women than men, including systemic lupus erythematosus (Jiang
et al., 2005), Sjogren’s syndrome (Patel and Shahane, 2014)
and rheumatoid arthritis (Oliver and Silman, 2009). Gender
diﬀerences have also been reported for the outcome of microbial
infections (Fischer et al., 2015). Interestingly, the onset of
autoimmune diseases, asthma (Akinbami et al., 2016) and other
diseases occurs after menarche or during the reproductive
period of women. Experimental ﬁndings in mice have shown
that
female sexual
hormones, and immunity are associated with the development
of autoimmune diseases (Yurkovetskiy et al., 2013, 2015),
including type 1 diabetes (Markle et al., 2013) and rheumatoid
arthritis (Wu et al., 2010). The non-obese diabetic (NOD)
mouse exhibits spontaneous, immune-mediated pancreatic beta
cell destruction causing type 1 diabetes (T1D) with a complex
genetic and environmental etiology. The NOD T1D incidence
shows a strong 2:1 female to male sex bias (Markle et al., 2013).
Interestingly, germ-free NOD female mice lack this gender bias
for diabetes. Additionally, after castration, males exhibit a similar
microbiota composition and T1D incidence to females (Markle
et al., 2013). In general, this study shows that the microbiome
is a causal factor and not simply a consequence of autoimmune
disease.

the interactions among the microbiota,

The Relevance of the Gut Microbiota in
the Health of Menopausal Women
When the interaction between the gut microbiota and estrogen is
altered due to a lack of estrogen, this relationship is restructured
according to the new circumstances. However, host functional
alterations, such as metabolic and immunological changes, also
occur.

Obesity aﬀects 65% of postmenopausal women and is
associated with the onset of metabolic dysfunction (Leeners
et al., 2017). Multiple studies have suggested that postmenopausal
women exhibit increased total fat mass and abdominal fat and

levels or the absence of estrogen hormone in the metabolism of
women have not been suﬃciently studied and require further
clariﬁcation.

Another link between the gut microbiome and menopausal
health is related to bone. Interesting, the gut microbiota has
also been found to inﬂuence bone homeostasis. Approximately
one in two women over age 50 will break a bone because of
osteoporosis. A study that involved twenty postmenopausal
women with a mean age of 65 years showed that the group
that consumed Lactobacillus helveticus-fermented milk had
increased serum calcium levels and reduced bone reabsorption
compared with those of the control milk consumption group
(Narva et al., 2004). Experimental studies have also demonstrated
similar results. For instance, L. reuteri treatment signiﬁcantly
protected ovariectomized mice from bone loss and increases
in bone marrow CD4+ T-lymphocytes, which promote
osteoclastogenesis (Britton et al., 2014). Another study that
investigated probiotic treatment for cortical bone loss found
two inﬂammatory cytokines, TNF-α
reduced expression of
and IL-1β, and increased expression of osteoprotegerin, a
potent inhibitor of osteoclastogenesis, in the cortical bone of
ovariectomized mice (Ohlsson et al., 2014). Additionally, sex
steroid deprivation has been reported to promote intestinal
permeability (Figure 1), and the oral administration of
L. rhamnosus GG (LGG) or VSL#3 (a combination of tree
probiotics) to estrogen-deﬁcient mice signiﬁcantly reinforced
intestinal barrier integrity and completely protected the mice
against sex steroid depletion-induced bone loss (Li et al., 2016).
Importantly, to conﬁrm the role of the gut microbiota in bone
health, another experiment also showed that germ-free mice are
protected against the bone loss induced by the absence of sex
steroids (Li et al., 2016).

We must mention that the gut microbiota may inﬂuence
the risk for breast cancer through eﬀects on endogenous
estrogens produced by adipose tissue in postmenopausal women
(Figure 1) (Key et al., 2003). A cross-sectional study on 60
healthy postmenopausal women found that women with a more
diverse gut microbiome and an abundance of four Clostridia
taxa exhibited an elevated urinary ratio of hydroxylated estrogen
metabolites to parent estrogens (Fuhrman et al., 2014), which
is related to the etiology of breast cancer (Flores et al.,
2012; Kwa et al., 2016). However, another study compared 48
postmenopausal breast cancer patients and 48 control patients
and observed that postmenopausal women with breast cancer
exhibited an altered composition and estrogen-independent
low diversity of their microbiota (Goedert et al., 2015). These
diﬀerent ﬁndings on gut microbiota diversity and breast cancer
could be explained by the fact that disease outcome or disease

consumption of the soy isoﬂavone daidzein, which is metabolized
by some bacteria of the microbiota to generate equol and
O-desmethylangolensin (ODMA), could represent a therapeutic
strategy for breast cancer prevention. Some, but not all, studies
have shown a lower risk of breast cancer associated with equol
production (Hullar et al., 2014). However, only approximately
30–50% of the population can metabolize daidzein (Frankenfeld
et al., 2004; Uehara, 2013; Nakatsu et al., 2014) to equol, likely

decreased lean body mass compared with those of premenopausal
women, regardless of aging (Aloia et al., 1995; Schreiner et al.,
1996; Cordina-Duverger et al., 2016). The accumulation of
abdominal
in postmenopausal women appears to be a
critical factor in the development of insulin resistance and
type 2 diabetes (Lobo et al., 2014), and the relationship between
the gut microbiota and a lack of estrogen is likely responsible for
weight gain and lipid deposition during menopause (Figure 1).
The gut microbiota can metabolize estrogen-like compounds
such as isoﬂavonoids, which are found in soy foods, and promote
the growth of some speciﬁc bacteria (Frankenfeld et al., 2014;
Chen and Madak-Erdogan, 2016; Miller et al., 2017). Indeed,
the administration of soy isoﬂavones to postmenopausal women
was shown to increase the concentration of Biﬁdobacterium and
suppress Clostridiaceae, which are known to be involved in
inﬂammatory diseases (Frankenfeld et al., 2014; Nakatsu et al.,
2014). This suppression of Clostridiaceae, a family of Clostridia
associated with obesity (Figure 1),
likely explains why diets
containing phytoestrogens have been shown to improve weight
gain in menopausal women.

Few studies have investigated whether prebiotics and
probiotics can improve insulin sensitivity in postmenopausal
women or body fat in mice. The intake of ﬂaxseed mucilage, a
prebiotic, is known to improve insulin sensitivity and alter the
gut microbiota in obese postmenopausal women (Brahe et al.,
2015). Thus far, the implications of the gut microbiota with low

due to the host microbiota. Therefore, an investigation into
the administration of the soy isoﬂavone daidzein together with
probiotic bacteria to produce equol is warranted and could oﬀer
beneﬁts in the prevention of breast cancer in menopausal women.
