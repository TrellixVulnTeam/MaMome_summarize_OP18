high-throughput sequencing platform that enables analysis of all the genomes within an ecosystem
sample (shotgun metagenomics), or a description of the taxa within a given community by sequencing
conserved marker genes, such as the 16srRNA gene of bacteria and archaea (marker gene metagenomics)
thus removing the requirement for cultivation of clonal cultures  Indeed, such is the interest in the
gut microbiota, it has been reported that in 2017 alone, approximately 4000 research papers on the
topic were published, with more than 12,900 papers published in the preceding four years  and to
date the bacterial component has received the most attention. This vast array of data has contributed
to a deeper understanding of the role of the gut microbiome in health and disease, the factors which
shape it, and the potential to harness its therapeutic potential for optimal health.

The gut microbiota serves the host by interacting directly or indirectly with host cells, the latter of
which comes about through microbially-produced bioactive molecules, thus the microbiota is capable
of regulating numerous biological pathways involved in immunity and energy homeostasis, while also
protecting the host against pathogens through colonisation resistance. The dysbiotic microbiota, which
has deviated from the ‘healthy’ status in terms of diversity and functionality, has been implicated in
a range of diseases, including inﬂammatory bowel diseases (IBDs)  neuropsychiatric
disorders and cardiometabolic diseases, including obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular
disease  These diseases tend to inﬂict those living a Westernised lifestyle. Indeed, greater economic
development has been shown to correlate with signiﬁcantly lower within-host gut microbiota diversity,
a common feature of the dysbiotic microbiota 

Many researchers have suggested that the gut microbiome can be considered as a virtual organ
but unlike any other organ in the human body, the gut microbiome represents a source of signiﬁcant
inter-individual variation, rendering the analysis of it ever more complicated. However, this vast
inter-individual variation is now being seized upon as an opportunity to utilize the microbiome for
precision medicine  Indeed, along with the human genome, the
human microbiome has been implicated as the main source of human variation modulating dietary
responses  This variation presumably goes a long way to explaining the pandemic surge in
metabolic diseases despite the fact that universal advice and education on healthy eating practices
have never been more readily available.

Therefore, the overall aim of this two-part review is to investigate the potential of the microbiome
for precision microbiomics, particularly in relation to nutrition. In this regard, precision microbiomics
can be described as the use of the gut microbiome as a biomarker to predict the eﬀect of speciﬁc dietary
components on host health and the use of these data to design precision diets and interventions that
ensure optimal health.

In Part I, we describe the development of the gut microbiota throughout life along with the factors
that shape its composition and how it contributes to host health. We look at dietary practices and
speciﬁc dietary components that inﬂuence the composition and functionality of the gut microbiota and
the consequences for human health with a focus on infection, inﬂammation and metabolic disease.
In Part II, we focus on the potential use of the microbiome to prevent disease and promote health.
We present research regarding opportunities to modulate the microbiota for prevention of over- and
under- nutrition through probiotics, prebiotics and ﬁbre and we look at the impact of environment and
life-stage on the gut microbiota and health and dietary strategies and interventions for optimising
health. Finally, in Part II, we provide evidence from recent research that the gut microbiome has
potential to serve as a biomarker of human responsiveness to diet and assess where this current
knowledge-base places us in terms of putting precision microbiomics into everyday practice and
discuss the value of present-day commercial microbiome testing.

2. Development of Microbiota from Birth/Young versus Mature versus Aged Microbiota

Humans encounter their initial gut microbiota in very early life with most studies focusing on
colonisation after birth and the microbial assembly that ensues. Some studies have led to the hypothesis
that colonisation begins in utero by providing evidence of a placental microbiome in healthy pregnancies,

Nutrients 2019, 11, 923

the presence of microorganisms in the amniotic fluid and meconium. These studies have been presented
and critically assessed in a recent review by Perez-Mu ˇnoz et al.  The authors concluded that there is
insufficient evidence to date to support the ‘in utero colonisation hypothesis’, since the studies lacked
appropriate controls for contamination, the molecular approaches used were incapable of studying
low-biomass microbial populations and evidence of bacterial viability was not provided. Thus, for the
purpose of this review, we have focused on gut microbiota development from birth onwards.

Although gut microbiota composition varies considerably between infants certain patterns have
been identiﬁed. Several factors have been shown to inﬂuence microbial colonisation of the gut at this
stage, including gestational age, birth mode, sanitation, antibiotic exposure, feeding regime and host
genetics 
Depletion of the available oxygen creates the necessary environment for the establishment of strict
anaerobes  Anaerobes which colonise the gut in the early days and weeks of life include
Biﬁdobacterium, Bacteroides, Clostridia and Parabacteroides  Although the diversity of the
microbiota is generally low at this stage, dominated largely by members of the Actinobacteria phylum
in the case of full-term spontaneously vaginally delivered infants, it has been shown to be greatest in
this cohort compared to full-term infants delivered by caesarean section (dominated by Firmicutes) or
pre-term infants (dominated by Proteobacteria) at one week old  Interestingly, by week 24, no
signiﬁcant diﬀerences in alpha diversity were recorded between any of these groups . Diversity
increases with age with a gradual increase in the presence of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes by the ﬁrst
year (Swedish infants) where the introduction of
solid food to the diet has been identiﬁed as an important step in the succession of the microbiota 
(Spanish infants), and (Danish infants). In terms of metabolic function, genes involved in the
de novo biosynthesis of folate have been shown to be enriched in the infant microbiome across three
diﬀerent populations (Malawian rural communities, Amerindians from the Amazonas of Venezuela,
families from the USA) relative to adults  By three years of age, obligate anaerobes have been
shown to dominate the microbiota in breast-fed infants which is trending towards an adult-like
composition. The establishment of a stable adult-like microbiota occurs between 2–5 years of age and
is dominated by Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes 

Few studies have speciﬁcally investigated the pre- adolescent and adolescent microbiota of healthy
humans. However, those which have investigated these age groups indicate that the microbiota has
not yet reached the adult-state and is providing essential functions towards the developmental process
of its human host. The gut microbiota of children is more stable than that of infants with composition
largely inﬂuenced by dietary habits and geography  The pre-adolescent microbiota (7–12 years of
age) is still in a state of immaturity and based on observations from a group of children from Houston,
Texas, has been shown to be more diverse and harbor signiﬁcantly greater abundances of Firmicutes
and Actinobacteria than observed in healthy adults  The pre-adolescent microbiome was also
found to be enriched in functions potentially involved in ongoing development, such as vitamin B12
synthesis and de novo folate synthesis relative to the adult microbiome. In terms of the adolescent
microbiota, Agans et al. identiﬁed a core microbiota of 46 species common to both adults and
adolescents who consumed a standard Western diet, however, the abundances of the
genera Biﬁdobacterium and Clostridium were signiﬁcantly higher in adolescents relative to adults.

The healthy adult gut microbiota is composed primarily of the phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes,
and to a lesser extent the phyla Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia  As with
any age-group, due to the extensive inter-individual variation, it has been virtually impossible to
deﬁne the composition of the ‘healthy’ adult gut microbiota. However, the ‘enterotype’ concept
was introduced in 2011  when faecal metagenomes of individuals from America, Europe and
Japan were found to be dominated by one of three diﬀerent bacterial communities, namely Bacteroides
(enterotype 1), Prevotella (enterotype 2) or Ruminococcus (enterotype 3). The enterotype ‘concept’ has
since been used in other studies when evaluating the gut microbiota as we will see further on, although
further analysis has resulted in the identiﬁcation of only two enterotypes, one of which is dominated

Nutrients 2019, 11, 923

4 of 45

by Prevotella and the other by Bacteroides which have been linked to long term carbohydrate-, or animal
fat and protein-rich diets, respectively  More recently, it has been suggested that Prevotella and
Bacteroides should be interpreted as ‘biomarkers’ of diet, lifestyle and disease state given that gradients
of both Bacteroides and Prevotella have been found within gut communities as opposed to distinct and
consistent community taxa 

Reports on the estimated number of species and strains in an individual have varied greatly but
in a study examining the stability of the gut microbiota in 37 US adults over a ﬁve year period, Faith et
al. reported an average of 101 ± 27 species and 195 ± 48 strains in the faecal gut microbiota of each
individual with family members sharing strains, which was not observed in unrelated individuals.
However, other studies estimate the number of species to be greater than 1000  More recently,
Forster et al. presented the Human Gastrointestinal Bacteria Culture Collection which consisted
of 737 whole-genome-sequenced bacterial isolates, representing 273 diﬀerent species, including 105
novel species from 31 families found in the human gastrointestinal microbiota. The healthy adult
microbiota has been shown to be stable over long periods of time but can be inﬂuenced by a
number of factors. These include geographical location albeit diet would appear to be an
important contributing factor in this regard  and indirectly by
consumption of antibiotic containing animal derived products, such as beef and chicken as a result of
their use in livestock production and hormonal
changes which
has been found to be reduced/altered in individuals with certain diseases, particularly those typiﬁed
by a dysregulated immune response (as discussed further on).

Ageing has a signiﬁcant impact on the gut microbiota with dramatic compositional and functional
changes observed in the elderly microbiota (in general >65 years). Several physiological and lifestyle
changes associated with the ageing process may be contributing factors resulting in changes in dietary
habits and ultimately nutrition, including a decline in dentition and salivary function, a reduction
in digestion and absorption, due to gastrointestinal dysmotility, changes in appetite as a result of
prescribed drugs and psychological state, or changes in living conditions, such as residential care
or hospitalisation  Gastric hypochlorhydria which is associated with ageing and is prevalent in
individuals experiencing or who have experienced Helicobacter pylori infection can cause malabsorption
and bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine 

In general, the elderly microbiota has been characterised by a decline in microbial diversity, an
increase in the abundance of opportunistic pathogens and a decrease in species associated with short
chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, in particular butyrate  The inter-individual variation observed
in the gut microbiota of adults is even greater in the elderly cohort. Indeed, while Bacteroidetes was
found to be the dominant phylum in an elderly Irish cohort (age 65 years and older), the proportion of
Bacteroidetes within individual composition datasets ranged from 3% to 92%, while the proportion of
Firmicutes ranged from 7% to 94% reported a change in the ratio of Firmicutes:
Bacteriodetes with age, which was recorded as 0.4 in infants  10.9 in adults
 of which the latter two consumed an
unrestricted Western-type diet. In a study involving 178 elderly Irish subjects  Claesson et
al. identiﬁed distinct microbiota composition groups as a result of residence location (community
versus day-hospital versus rehabilitation versus long-stay residential care) which also overlapped with
diet (low fat/high ﬁbre versus moderate fat/high ﬁbre versus moderate fat/low ﬁbre versus high fat/low
ﬁbre, respectively). The gut microbiota of people in long-stay care was found to be signiﬁcantly less
diverse than that of healthy community dwellers, which was found to be more similar to healthy young
adults. Furthermore, increased frailty as observed in the less healthy, long-stay subjects correlated
with a loss of community-associated microbiota. Indeed, a distinct negative correlation between frailty
and gut microbiota alpha diversity has been reported  In the same study, the species Eubacterium
dolichum and Eggerthella lenta were found to be more abundant with frailty, while a Faecalibacterium
prausnitzii operational taxonomic unit (OTU) was less abundant in frailer individuals. Interestingly,

Nutrients 2019, 11, 923

5 of 45

F. prausnitzii is an important butyrate producer  More
recently, Haran et al. also reported lower abundances of butyrate-producing organisms in the
microbiota of American elderly nursing home residents (age 65 years or older) consuming a low-ﬁbre,
typical nursing home diet with increasing frailty and higher abundances of recognised dysbiotic species.
Increasing age was also associated with a decrease in the abundance of microbiome-encoded genes
and pathways associated with vitamin B, a nitrogenous base and essential amino acid production.

Interestingly, the centenarian microbiota has been shown to signiﬁcantly diﬀer from
that of young adults  being
characterised by an enrichment in facultative anaerobes, mainly pathobionts, and a rearrangement in the
Firmicutes population with a marked decrease in symbiotic species associated with anti-inﬂammatory
properties e.g., F. prausnitzii and relatives. Increased inﬂammatory markers were also identiﬁed in
centenarian blood samples, indicative of increased inﬂammatory status. Rampelli et al. also
reported a rearrangement in Firmicutes in Italian centenarians  which was not observed
in 70-year-old subjects. In this study a functional description of the coding capacity of an ageing
human cohort revealed a decrease in saccharolytic potential and an increased abundance of proteolytic
functions in the centenarian microbiome. Remarkably, a study investigating the semi-supercentarian
microbiota revealed not only a decrease in saccharolytic butyrate producers
(Faecalibacterium, Coprococcus, Roseburia) and an increase in potential opportunistic bacteria, as expected,
but also an enrichment and/or higher prevalence in health associated bacterial groups, including
Akkermansia, Biﬁdobacterium and Christensenellaceae. Whether these species were present at a younger
age or related to past lifestyle or genetics is not known 

In certain regions of the world, “healthy” ageing is the norm and the average lifespan of residents
surpasses general averages. Goatian village in Liuyang city of Hunan province in mid-South China is
such an example, which boasts an average lifespan of 92, much higher than the average 74.83 years
for China in general, along with a lack of chronic diseases amongst its people. An analysis of the gut
microbiota in its long-living elderly residents (ages spanning from 50 to >90 years) revealed much
greater species diversity than that observed in the control group (healthy subjects from other areas in
China, average age of 50 years) reported that the overall gut microbiota
composition of healthy aged Chinese subjects was similar to that of much younger people, reporting
little diﬀerences between individuals from 30 to >100 years which the authors speculate may be a
consequence of the healthy lifestyle and diet of the study subjects.

3. Role of Microbiome in Health, Development and Immune Functioning

The gut microbiome is integral to the health of its host, serving a myriad of functions. It provides
essential nutrients and bioactive metabolites, which can be produced directly by the microorganisms
or indirectly by microbial conversion of host or environmental molecules. It is involved in energy
regulation (as discussed in Section 5). It prevents pathogen colonisation directly or indirectly through a
phenomenon referred to as colonisation resistance. It sustains the integrity of the mucosal barrier and
is an essential component in the orchestration of immune functioning within the gut. The bidirectional
interactions within the brain-gut-microbiome axis, in which the gut microbes communicate to the
central nervous system, have been demonstrated largely by preclinical and some clinical studies 
Alterations in brain-gut-microbiome communication have been implicated in various disease states,
from irritable bowel syndrome to psychiatric and neurologic disorders, and this is an area of research
that has the potential for identiﬁcation of novel therapeutic targets and therapies 

3.1. Nutrients and Bioactive Metabolites

Fruits, vegetables and cereals are major components of the human diet providing essential
carbohydrates and dietary ﬁbres, although digestion of the latter is beyond the scope of the human
genome identiﬁed only 17 enzymes within the human genome to breakdown
carbohydrate nutrients which included starch, lactose and sucrose. Thus, plant cell wall polysaccharides

Nutrients 2019, 11, 923

6 of 45

and resistant starch, which constitute most dietary ﬁbres and cannot be digested or absorbed in the small
intestine, enter the large intestine and undergo microbial breakdown and subsequent fermentation 
The microbiota also feeds on animal-derived dietary carbohydrates (glycosaminoglycans and N-linked
glycans from cartilage and tissue), host epithelial glycome, and microbe-derived carbohydrates from
resident gut microbes or foodborne microbes  Collectively, the carbohydrates consumed by the
microbiota have been termed “microbiota accessible carbohydrates” (MACs)

fermentable
monosaccharides  For example, the gut bacterium Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron was recently shown
to metabolise the most structurally complex plant polysaccharide known, rhamnogalacturonan-II,
using a highly speciﬁc enzyme system  Biﬁdobacterium longum strains derived from the infant gut
were shown to be capable of metabolising human milk oligosaccharides  In-silico analysis of
CAZyme proﬁles in the guts of 448 individuals from diverse geographies and age groups revealed
89 CAZyme families which were present across 85% of the gut microbiome and revealed several
geography/age-speciﬁc trends in the CAZyme repertoires of individuals  The major end products
of microbial fermentation of the resulting monosaccharides are the SCFAs, including butyrate,
propionate, and acetate which reach a combined concentration of 50–150 mM in the colon at a ratio
of 1:1:3, respectively  They are rapidly absorbed by the intestinal epithelial cells where they
are involved in a number of cellular and regulatory processes with only 5% excreted in
faeces  Butyrate is mainly produced by Firmicutes, propionate by Bacteroidetes, and acetate by
most gut anaerobes and plays an
important role in brain function and anti-inﬂammatory
properties  Propionate
contributes to gluconeogenesis in the liver and, along with butyrate, has been shown to activate
intestinal gluconeogenesis, albeit both use diﬀerent circuits  Propionate derived from the gut
microbiota has also been shown to reduce cancer cell proliferation in the liver  The SCFAs are
also involved in regulating immune responses, a topic which has been extensively reviewed by
Corrêa et al.  For example, acetate has recently been shown to promote intestinal antibody IgA
responses to the gut microbiota via the G protein coupled receptor GPR43  Intestinal IgA is
specialised in protecting the mucosa  These SCFAs also stimulate secretion of gut hormones, such
as glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and plasma peptide YY (PYY) involved in appetite regulation
and satiety from enteroendocrine cells proposedly through the SCFA receptors GPR41 and
GPR43  thus playing a role in energy regulation in the body. Unsurprisingly, changes in
the production of these compounds as a result of disturbances to the gut microbiota can result in
pathological consequences for the host. As an example, increased acetate production from an altered
gut microbiota in a rodent model was shown to promote metabolic syndrome 

The gut microbiota is also responsible for the biosynthesis of several essential vitamins, including
B vitamins, such as cobalamin, folic acid, biotin, thiamine, riboﬂavin, nicotinic acid, pyrodixine and
pantothenic acid, as well as vitamin K observed vitamin
biosynthesis pathways across the three identiﬁed enterotypes; however, enterotype 1 was enriched in
the biosynthesis of riboﬂavin, biotin, ascorbate and pantothenic acid, while enterotype 2 was enriched
in the biosynthesis of thiamine and folic acid.

Primary bile acids are produced in the liver from dietary cholesterol and cholesterol derived
from hepatic synthesis, and their main function is to aid absorption of dietary lipids and lipid soluble
nutrients  However, bile acids are also important signalling molecules and are known to activate a
number of nuclear receptors, including farnesoid X receptor (FXR), preganane X receptor, and vitamin
D receptor, as well as the G-protein-coupled receptor TGR5, and cell signalling pathways in the liver
and GIT thus modulating their own biosynthesis, as well as glucose, lipid, and energy metabolism 
In humans, 200-800 mg of bile acids escape enterohepatic circulation every day, pass into the colon
and are metabolised by bacteria to secondary bile acids  In a mouse model, such secondary bile
acids produced through the action of bacterial bile salt hydrolase (BSH) have been shown to regulate

Nutrients 2019, 11, 923

7 of 45

weight gain, lipid metabolism and cholesterol levels via regulation of key genes in the liver or small
intestine  The gut microbiota has also been shown to inhibit bile acid synthesis in the liver by
alleviation of FXR inhibition in the ileum 

In recent years, there has been a growing appreciation for the ability of the gut microbiota to
produce neurochemicals that can inﬂuence the peripheral enteric and central nervous systems 
For example, gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain 
and neuropsychiatric disorders, including anxiety and depression have been linked to GABA system
dysfunction  Strains of culturable lactobacilli and biﬁdobacteria from the human intestine
were shown to produce GABA, namely Lactobacillus brevis, Biﬁdobacterium dentium, adolescentis and
infantis  Furthermore, GABA was found to serve as a growth factor for a previously uncultured
gut bacterium, Flavonifractor sp. which was shown to ferment GABA  In the same study, the
authors identiﬁed several gut bacteria capable of producing GABA which included Bacteroides, Dorea,
Parabacteroides, Alistipes and Ruminococcus species. More recently, a co-culture experiment revealed that
GABA produced by Bacteroides fragilis was essential for the growth of a gut isolate termed KLE1738
which is believed to be an unreported bacterial genus  This led to the isolation of a variety
of GABA-producing bacteria and the Bacteriodes species in particular were found to produce large
quantities of GABA. Furthermore, in the same study relative abundance levels of faecal Bacteriodes
negatively correlated with brain signatures associated with depression in patients with major depressive
disorder. Bacterially-produced GABA is generated by the enzyme glutamate decarboxylase (GAD)
which catalyzes the irreversible α-decarboxylation of glutamate to GABA and is believed to protect the
microorganism against stomach acidity 
Interestingly, daily consumption of a GABA-producing Bif. dentium gut isolate was found to modulate
sensory neuron activity in a rat faecal retention model of visceral hypersensitivity revealing that
bacterially-produced GABA can modulate abdominal pain  GABA-enriched black soybean milk
fermented with a GABA-producing ﬁsh gut isolate, L. brevis, generated similar antidepressant activity
in rats as the common antidepressant drug, ﬂuoxetine, but without the side eﬀects normally associated
with the drug, such as appetite loss and reduced body weight 

Serotonin is a brain neurotransmitter and performs regulatory
functions in the gut and other organ systems  It is derived from the amino acid tryptophan
and plays an important role in the regulation of mood such that several antidepressants act on
serotonin transporters in the brain demonstrated that human- and mouse-derived
gut bacteria promote serotonin biosynthesis in colonic enterochromaﬃn cells which supply serotonin to
the lumen, mucosa and circulating platelets. Spore forming bacteria, dominated by clostridial species,
were found to elicit this eﬀect. Furthermore, conventional mice were found to have 2.8 times more
plasma serotonin levels than their germ-free counterparts  This peripherally produced molecule
does not pass the blood brain barrier under physiological conditions but is an important signalling
molecule in the gut involved in peristalsis, secretion, vasodilation, pain perception and nausea, as well
as promoting inﬂammation and being involved in neuron development and maintenance in the enteric
nervous system, while platelet serotonin derived from the gut inﬂuences bone development amongst
other functions  The mechanisms involved in gut microbiota-mediated serotonin biosynthesis
have not yet been fully elucidated but are thought to be linked to microbial metabolite-stimulation of
the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase 1 in enterochromaﬃn cells which produces a serotonin precursor
that is subsequently metabolised to serotonin  In particular, rectal injection with the microbial
metabolites deoxycholate, p-aminobenzoate, α-tocopherol and tyramine, were shown to increase
colonic and serum concentrations of serotonin in mice 

Metabolism of tryptophan in the gut results in tryptophan catabolites which have profound eﬀects
on the host  Direct transformation of tryptophan by intestinal microbes results in the formation of
several molecules, including ligands for the ligand-activated aryl hydrocarbon receptors (AhRs) 
AhRs, which are transcription factors, are expressed by several cells of both the adaptive and innate
immune systems  Upon binding of AhR to its ligand molecule, the activated transcription factor

Nutrients 2019, 11, 923

8 of 45

translocates into the nucleus of the cell where it mediates cell-speciﬁc transcriptome changes  Thus,
AhR signalling plays a key role in immune functioning in health and disease. Lamas et al. showed
that intestinal inﬂammation in mice harbouring a microbiota incapable of metabolizing tryptophan
was attenuated following treatment with Lactobacillus strains capable of activating AhRs through the
production of tryptophan metabolites. In the same study, faecal samples from healthy subjects induced
signiﬁcantly greater AhR activation compared to faecal samples from IBD subjects, the latter of which
harbored signiﬁcantly less tryptophan and tryptophan metabolites. The tryptophan-metabolising
strain Peptostreptococcus russellii provided a protective eﬀect against colitis in mice, which the authors
suggest is linked to its ability to produce the tryptophan metabolite and AhR ligand, indoleacrylic acid
which mitigates inﬂammatory responses and promotes intestinal barrier function  The authors
also noted a diminishment of tryptophan-metabolising capacity in stool samples of IBD patients.
The metabolite indole has been shown to enhance epithelial barrier function and attenuate indicators
of inﬂammation 

3.2. Colonisation Resistance

The intestinal microbiota protects its host against colonisation by exogenous pathogens and
prevents the overgrowth of potentially pathogenic endogenous members, referred to as colonisation
resistance  This phenomenon is elicited through competition for nutrients and colonisation sites,
direct inhibition of pathogens through the production of antimicrobial substances, and indirectly
through modulation of the luminal environment and via host-commensal interactions involving the
epithelial barrier function, modulation of the host cell surface and the host immune system 

Members of the established microbiota are controlled by ‘substrate competition,’ defined as the
superior ability of a species/strain to utilise one or a few substrates over other species and the control of
that population by the limited concentration of these substrates  Furthermore, one microorganism’s
by-product can serve as substrate for another  In this regard, nutrient resources in the gut are in huge
demand and simultaneously limited, making it challenging to become established or outcompete with
resident microbiota. Indeed, nutrient utilisation by the colonic microbiota of mice was shown to restrain
the growth of Clostridium difficile, since it was incapable of competing with the mouse microbiota for the
available carbon sources  Unfavourable environmental conditions created as a result of commensal
fermentations can also inhibit the growth of undesirable microorganisms. The utilisation of human milk
(cid:48)
oligosaccharides, particularly the dominant secretor associated oligosaccharide 2
-fucosyllactose, by
infant strains of bifidobacteria led to an increase in their proportions, an increase in lactate concentration
and a subsequent reduction in pH which was shown to decrease the proportions of Escherichia coli
and Clostridium perfringens during in vitro anaerobic fermentations  Furthermore, consumption
of butyrate by epithelial cells as an energy source has been implicated as important in maintaining a
hypoxic environment in the gut lumen  Decreased intestinal butyrate levels due to depletion of
a commensal butyrate producer in a mouse model resulted in increased epithelial oxygenation and
aerobic expansion of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium  Butyrate has also been shown to
down-regulate virulence gene expression in Salmonella 

In terms of niche competition, Lee et al. identified specific colonisation factors conserved
within the Bacteroides genus, one of the most prominent genera of the human microbiota. The specific
genetic locus referred to as commensal colonisation f actors (ccf ) was shown to be up-regulated in
Bac. fragilis during gut colonisation, especially at the colonic surface such that the strain was able to
reside deep within the crypt channels whereas ccf mutants were defective in terms of crypt association.
Such species-specific physical interactions with the host provide an example of direct competition for
niche occupation.

The gut microbiota is a rich reservoir of bacteriocin producers  Bacteriocins are
ribosomally synthesised peptides with antimicrobial activity against either a broad range of species or
a narrow range of closely-related species. Their mode of action varies depending on the bacteriocin
class, but they generally exert their antimicrobial activity by forming pores in the target cell (Classes

Nutrients 2019, 11, 923

9 of 45

I and II), by degrading cell wall peptidoglycan (Class III bacteriolysins) or interfering with cellular
processes (Class III non-lytic bacteriocins)  The genetic machinery for bacteriocin synthesis is
encoded in gene clusters or operons where many of the genes are conserved. Based on this knowledge,
Walsh et al. identiﬁed 74 bacteriocin gene clusters within the genomes of the GIT subset of the
Human Microbiome Project’s reference genome database using an in-silico approach of which the most
commonly identiﬁed were bacteriolysins, then lantibiotics and sactibiotics. Thuricin CD is an example
of a sactibiotic bacteriocin produced by a human gut isolate, Bacillus thuringiensis  While it has a
narrow spectrum of inhibition, thuricin CD is capable of killing a wide range of C. diﬃcile isolates, its
antimicrobial activity being as potent as the antibiotics vancomycin and metronidazole, but without the
concomitant damage to other members of the microbiota  Bacteriocin production can also aid niche
occupation of the producing strain. Indeed, bacteriocin production in Enterococcus faecalis harboring
the bacteriocin-encoding conjugative plasmid pPD1 was shown to replace indigenous enterococci and
out-competed E. faecalis strains lacking the plasmid in a mouse model  Supplementing mice
with bacteriocin-producing strains resulted in transient advantageuous changes, such as inhibition of
Staphylococcus by enterocins and Enterococcus by garvicin and promotion of LAB by sakacin, plantaricins
and garvicin 

Other antimicrobials generated by the gut microbiota can also aid colonisation resistance.
For example, a single bacterial species, namely Clostridium scindens, was shown to confer colonisation
resistance against C. diﬃcile infection in vivo  In this instance, secondary bile acids generated by
C. scindens from host-derived bile cells were found to inhibit the pathogen.

3.3. Immunity and Mucosal Integrity

Commensal interactions with the host promote immune system maturation and immune
homeostasis through complex microbiota-host networks although much of our understanding of these
mechanisms today have been extrapolated from animal or in vitro studies  We have already
seen how several microbial metabolites play essential roles as signalling molecules for the immune
system, such as the SCFAs and tryptophan metabolites. More speciﬁcally, a polysaccharide (PSA)
produced by Bac. fragilis was shown to promote cellular and physical maturation of the developing
immune system in mice 
and plays an important role in the development of the infant immune system. A 15 kDa protein
produced by F. prausnitzii, a commensal microbe deﬁcient in Crohn’s disease patients, was shown to
have anti-inﬂammatory properties, decreasing activation of the NF-κB pathway and also prevented
colitis in an animal model  M-cells are speciﬁc phagocytic epithelial cells which sample particulate
antigens showed that eﬃcient induction of IgA is brought about by M-cell
sampling of commensal microbes. Paneth cells (a specialized intestinal epithelial lineage) sense enteric
bacteria through activation of the MyD88-dependent toll-like receptor which results in the induction
of several antimicrobial factors that are essential for controlling bacterial translocation across the
intestinal barrier  Colonisation by segmented ﬁlamentous bacteria was shown to induce the
maturation of T-cell responses in a gnotobiotic mouse model, suggesting these microbes could play a
role in the postnatal maturation of the gut immune system  These studies provide a snapshot
of how commensals modulate host immunity. The importance of the microbiota for host immunity
can also be appreciated from the consequences of its absence in germ free animals. Indeed, germ free
animals exhibit reduced expression of IgA and antimicrobial peptides and are deﬁcient in Peyers’
patches 

Goblet cells are specialised epithelial cells that secrete mucus, composed primarily of
O-glycosylated proteins called mucins, resulting in the formation of a mucus layer whose composition
and density is inﬂuenced by the commensal microbiota  The mucus layer creates a
protective barrier for the epithelial cells making it diﬃcult for pathogens to gain access to epithelial
cell receptors  Germ free mice have been shown to have an extremely thin colonic mucus layer
which can be restored to levels observed in conventional mice following exposure to bacterial products,

Nutrients 2019, 11, 923

10 of 45

including peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharide  Mice treated with the antibiotic metronidazole
were shown to have a thinning of the mucus layer which correlated with an increased attachment of the
mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium  Certain commensals have been shown to modulate mucin
gene expression and glycosylation patterns  This may be achieved through the activity of
SCFAs which have been shown to increase expression of mucin-associated genes  Furthermore,
the SCFA butyrate provides energy for the epithelial cells and has also been implicated in enhancing
the intestinal barrier by up-regulating the tight junction protein, Claudin-1 

4. Low Diversity of the Microbiota Caused by Poor Quality Diet Linked With Risk of Infections
and Inﬂammation Predominantly

Dysbiosis is a term used to describe imbalances in gut microbiota communities and is linked with
disease when these imbalances negatively impact microbiota functions required for health or when
they promote disease occurrence  For a number of these diseases, the dysbiotic state is manifested
as a reduction in microbial diversity and often an increase in facultative anaerobes relative to the
‘healthy’ gut microbiota and recurrent
C. diﬃcile infection (CDI)  Such diseases tend to primarily inﬂict those living a Westernised
lifestyle and consuming a Western diet which is characterised by low fruit and vegetable intake and
high consumption of animal-derived protein (meat and processed meat), saturated fats, reﬁned grains,
sugar, salt, alcohol and corn-derived fructose (Figure 1). Whether these changes in microbial
diversity are the cause or consequence of these diseases is as yet unconﬁrmed, although having
reviewed a number of studies, Mosca et al. suggest the argument for a causal eﬀect is strong in
the case of several human conditions, a stance we concur with in terms of inﬂammation and infection
based on the body of research presented here.

Figure 1. Comparison of consequences of poor-quality diet versus a healthy diet on the gut and gut
microbiota (MUFAs = monounsaturated fatty acids; PUFAs = polyunsaturated fatty acids).

That diet inﬂuences the composition of the gut microbiota has been conﬁrmed in several
studies  Even short-term dietary changes (four days) have been shown to alter human gut
microbiota composition reported that the entirely
animal-based diet (meats, eggs and cheeses) had a greater impact on gut microbiota composition
than the plant-based diet (grains, legumes, fruits and vegetables), resulting in a decrease in plant
polysaccharide-metabolising Firmicutes (Roseburia, Eubacterium rectale, and Ruminococcus bromii) and

Nutrients 2019, 11, 923

an increase in the abundance of bile-tolerant microorganisms presumably owing to the increase in
bile acid secretion as a result of high fat intake  Indeed, the animal-based diet signiﬁcantly
increased the levels of faecal deoxycholic acid (DCA), a secondary bile acid produced by microbial
dehydroxylation of bile, and has been shown to promote liver cancer in mice  and inhibit the
growth of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes members in rats  Microbial genes required for DCA
production exhibited signiﬁcantly higher expression on the animal-based diet. Furthermore, the
abundance and activity of the sulﬁte-reducing bacterium, Bilophila wadsworthia, was also shown to be
increased on the animal-based diet.

In mouse models, this particular microorganism has been shown to cause IBD, which is thought
to be due to its production of hydrogen sulﬁde which inﬂames intestinal tissue  Overall microbial
gene expression was strongly linked to diet, thus as expected, the animal-based diet resulted in lower
levels of carbohydrate fermentation end-products, the SCFAs. Despite the increase in dietary ﬁbre,
four days of the plant-based diet did not increase the microbiota diversity of participants, most likely
owing to the short time frame. Two days after the animal-based diet ended, the gut microbiota of
participants reverted to their original structure. In a study investigating the associations between
long-term dietary habits and lifestyle, and short-term dietary changes, with gut microbiota composition,
Klimenko et al. reported that alpha diversity was positively linked to the number of vegetables
consumed in long-term dietary patterns.

In certain rural regions of the world, communities continue to live a traditional lifestyle and thus
consume diets resembling those of our early ancestors which are naturally high in ﬁbre. For example,
inhabitants of a rural African village in Burkina Faso still consume a high ﬁbre diet similar to that of
early human settlements at the time of the birth of agriculture. A comparative study examining the gut
microbiota composition of the children of Burkina Faso versus European children (from Florence, Italy)
consuming a Western diet (age of participants, 1−6 years) revealed a signiﬁcantly higher richness and
biodiversity in the gut microbiota of the Burkina Faso group  The African children also displayed
an enrichment of Bacteroidetes and depletion of Firmicutes relative to their European counterparts.
Within the Bacteroidetes, the genera Prevotella and Xylanibacter were uniquely abundant in the African
children being absent in the European children. These speciﬁc bacteria harbor genes for cellulose and
xylan hydrolysis. In contrast, the potentially pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae (Shigella and Escherichia)
were signiﬁcantly over-represented in European children compared to their African counterparts.
Furthermore, SCFAs were signiﬁcantly more abundant in the African children. The authors hypothesise
that the gut microbiota of the Burkina Faso children evolved with their polysaccharide-rich diet and
protects them from inﬂammation and non-infectious colonic diseases. The traditionally-living Hadza
people of Tanzania are one of the last hunter-gatherer communities in the world. A recent study
reported no evidence of cardiovascular disease risk factors in this population and older studies
reported that this group of people had relatively low rates of metabolic diseases, infectious diseases
or nutritional deﬁciencies compared to other settled groups in the surrounding regions 
A comparison of the gut microbiome of the Hadza people with an Italian urban cohort revealed higher
levels of microbial richness and diversity in the Hadza group  These studies suggest that the
Western microbiota, even in a healthy person, may in fact be dysbiotic in terms of microbial diversity
owing to the low consumption of MACs, and predisposes its host to a range of diseases, particularly
those which are characterised by an inappropriate immune response, a theory which has been proposed
by Sonnenburg and Sonnenburg 

The link between inﬂammation and low microbiota diversity was corroborated in a study involving
123 non-obese and 169 obese Danish individuals  Within this collective group of 292 subjects,
two groups could be diﬀerentiated by the number of gut microbial genes and thus bacterial richness.
The ‘low gene count’ (LGC) group represented 23% of the total population studied and included
a signiﬁcantly higher proportion of obese subjects. The LGC group was characterised by a more
pronounced inﬂammatory phenotype, marked overall adiposity, insulin resistance, and dyslipidaemia.
Obese individuals within the LGC group were found to gain more weight over time. Only a few

Nutrients 2019, 11, 923

12 of 45

bacterial species were suﬃcient to distinguish between the LGC group and the ‘high gene count’ (HGC)
group but interestingly anti-inﬂammatory species, such as F. prausnitzii were more prevalent
in HGC individuals while potentially pro-inﬂammatory species associated with IBD, Bacteroides and
Ruminococcus gnavus  were more frequently found in LGC individuals. In an accompanying
intervention study involving 49 obese and overweight subjects of whom 40% was deﬁned as LGC, a
similar phenomenon in terms of clinical parameters and inﬂammatory status was observed such that the
authors concluded that LGC individuals are at increased risk of obesity-associated co-morbidities 
Members of the LGC group were found to consume fewer fruits and vegetables and fewer ﬁshery
products than the HGC group. An energy-restricted diet with increased ﬁbre intake for six weeks
resulted in an increase in microbial gene richness in the LGC group which approached but remained
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent to that of the HGC group. Both groups showed a loss in body fat mass and an
improvement in clinical phenotypes (lipid and insulin levels and insulin resistance) and a trend towards
a decrease in inﬂammation (as measured by highly sensitive C-reactive protein) though the eﬀects were
more pronounced for the HGC group. Although this was a short-term intervention study, it suggests
that measures of gene richness and microbial diversity may help predict the eﬃcacy of interventions.
Furthermore, it seems that long term improvements to dietary habits may be required to improve
and stabilise gut microbial diversity which agrees with the observations of Klimenko et al. who
reported considerable correlations between long-term dietary habits and gut community structure.

Loss of microbial diversity is also associated with increased risk of infection, presumably due to loss
of colonisation resistance. For example, human studies have shown that the presence of the gut pathogen
C. diﬃcile is associated with decreased gut microbiota diversity in CDI patients  as well as in
asymptomatic carriers also reported a dramatic increase in endotoxin-producing
opportunistic pathogens and lactate-producing phylotypes in CDI patients. Community richness
and diversity were signiﬁcantly lower in the gut microbiota of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA)-positive patients compared to individuals without MRSA  The alpha diversity
of the gut microbiota of children suﬀering from acute infectious diarrhoea caused by rotavirus was
signiﬁcantly less diverse than those of healthy children  In this case, probiotic intervention for
ﬁve days resulted in recovery from diarrhoea. By day 3, diarrhoea symptoms had ceased, by days 10
and 30 after the intervention, microbiota diversity had increased to the point that it was no longer
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from healthy children. Future studies are required to determine the exact role of
the microbiota in diarrhoea-related processes. Other viral infections have also been associated with
low-diversity dysbiosis, including hepatitis C 

While the exact mechanisms underlying the link between low microbial diversity, diet and disease
are not fully understood, SCFAs undoubtedly play a role given that low MAC diets are directly linked
to low SCFA levels reported a signiﬁcant decrease in the proportion
of the SCFA-producing Clostridial Clusters IV/XIVa in intensive care unit patients 72 h following
hospital admission which was associated with reduced gut microbiota diversity and community
stability over time. Simultaneously, the facultative anaerobe Enterococcus signiﬁcantly expanded.
These changes were associated with receipt of broad-spectrum antibiotics. The depletion of SCFAs
and in particular butyrate producers has been reported in cases of CDI and asymptomatic carriage of
C. diﬃcile, in suﬀerers of nosocomial diarrhoea and in MRSA-positive patients  The potential
importance of butyrate in maintaining an oxygen-depleted environment in the lumen and impeding
colonisation by facultative anaerobes has already been mentioned  however, its speciﬁc role,
if any, in colonisation resistance against C. diﬃcile infection has not yet been elucidated and thus
the viable bacteria themselves are most likely the responsible agents  Indeed, the loss of a
speciﬁc butyrate-producing species, C. scindens, a member of the Clostridium XIVa clade  was
directly associated with susceptibility to C. diﬃcile infection in a mouse model as a result of antibiotic
treatment  Administration of C. scindens alone or in combination with three other bacteria to
antibiotic-treated mice ameliorated CDI. In this case, secondary bile acids produced by C. scindens were
found to be responsible for the anti-C. diﬃcile eﬀect. However, a recent study reported the presence

Nutrients 2019, 11, 923

13 of 45

of C. scindens and C. diﬃcile in the same stool sample and suggested that the former does not inhibit
the latter but the study does not provide data on bile acid proﬁles or the 7-α -dehydroxylating
activity of C. scindens, the enzyme responsible for secondary bile acid production.

Furthermore, Sonnenburg et al. showed that in the absence of dietary polysaccharides, a
human gut microbe turned to host mucus glycans as a nutrient source. Mouse models have shown that
a defective mucus barrier enables contact between epithelial cells and bacteria resulting in spontaneous
colitis in mice  But a direct connection
between dietary ﬁbre and the status of the colonic mucosal barrier was more recently presented in a
mouse study by Desai et al.  In this study, a dietary-ﬁbre deprived gut microbiota resorted to
host-secreted mucus glycoproteins, which resulted in the erosion of the colonic mucus barrier and
enabled the gut pathogen Cit. rodentium greater access to the epithelial cells, resulting in lethal colitis.
In another study, mice fed a Western style diet presented with an altered gut microbiota composition
that resulted in increased permeability and reduced growth rate of the inner mucus layer compared
with mice fed a CHOW diet  However, administration of Bif. longum or the ﬁbre inulin prevented
mucus defects. Inulin prevented penetrability of the inner colonic mucus layer while Bif. longum
restored mucus growth.

The Winning the War on Antibiotic Resistance (WARRIOR) project which is being undertaken by
researchers from the University of Wisconsin aims to investigate the relationship between dietary ﬁbre
intake, the gut microbiota and colonisation by multi-drug resistant microorganisms using 600 randomly
selected Wisconsin residents over the age of 18 of which the main results will be published in a
peer-reviewed journal  The results of this study should help us to further delineate the role of
diet and the microbiota in protecting against pathogen invasion.

5. Diet-Derived Microbial Metabolites—Many Are Beneﬁcial but Speciﬁc Metabolites Are
Associated with Risk of Metabolic Disease

Metabolic disease refers to any disease in which the normal metabolic processes in the body are
disrupted and examples include obesity, type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome, all of which are risk
factors for cardiovascular disease. Obesity and overweight are described as abnormal or excessive
fat accumulation that negatively impacts health and according to the WHO, obesity has tripled
since 1975. Indeed, in 2016, 39% of adults aged 18 years and over were described as overweight and
13% as obese  A recent study found that body mass index (BMI) had a J-shaped association with
overall mortality among 3.6 million adults in the UK  Obesity results from ingestion of excess
energy which does not get expended and is a strong risk factor for type 2 diabetes, the latter of which
is characterised by high blood sugar levels, insulin resistance and relative lack of insulin  In 2014,
the WHO estimated that 422 million adults had diabetes, of which the majority were inﬂicted
with type 2 diabetes. Diabetic dyslipidaemia which describes high levels of triglycerides in blood
plasma, increased levels of small, dense, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and decreased
levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is associated with insulin resistance and is a risk
factor for cardiovascular disease in diabetic individuals  Metabolic syndrome describes the
abnormal metabolism of glucose and lipids and is characterised by abdominal obesity along with two
or more of the following factors: reduced HDL cholesterol, elevated triglycerides, high blood pressure
and increased fasting blood glucose  Metabolic syndrome is also a risk factor for type 2 diabetes
along with cardiovascular disease 

The association between the gut microbiota and regulation of energy storage in the body was
initially documented in mice. Indeed, germ free mice are protected against the obesity that usually
develops after consuming a Western-style, high fat, sugar rich diet  Conventionalisation of
adult germ-free mice with a normal microbiota from conventionally raised animals resulted in a 60%
increase in body fat and insulin resistance within 14 days  The obesity-resistance phenotype
of germ-free animals fed a high fat diet was attributed to increased excretion of lipids and reduced
calorie consumption  The interactions between high fat diet and the gut microbiota in mice

Nutrients 2019, 11, 923

14 of 45

were shown to promote pro-inﬂammatory changes in the small intestine which preceded weight gain
and obesity and also showed signiﬁcant associations with obesity progression and development of
insulin resistance  In terms of microbiota composition, an increased abundance of Firmicutes
and decreased abundance of Bacteroidetes has been reported in obese mice compared to their lean
counterparts  It has been suggested that such a microbiota may be more eﬃcient at generating
energy in the form of SCFAs from the diet thus contributing to weight gain  Diﬀerences in gut
microbiota composition and functionality have also been recorded in humans between obese and
lean people. Ley et al. reported a decrease in the relative proportion of Bacteriodetes in obese
people relative to their lean counterparts and which was found to increase on calorie-restricted diets.
This observation was also corroborated by Turnbaugh et al. who also noted a higher proportion
of Actinobacteria in obese subjects. Furthermore, faecal SCFA concentrations tend to be higher in obese
individuals  The obese gut microbiota has also been characterised by reduced diversity and
altered representation of bacterial genes and metabolic pathways  More recently, a systematic
review investigated the link between the gut microbiota and low-grade inﬂammation, a hallmark of
obesity which plays a major role in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in humans  Fourteen,
mostly observational studies were included with n = 10 to 471 participants. Higher white blood cell
counts and high sensitivity C reactive protein levels were associated with lower gut microbial diversity,
and the abundances of Biﬁdobacterium, Faecalibacterium, Ruminococcus and Prevotella were inversely
linked to diﬀerent markers of low-grade inﬂammation. Compositional and functional diﬀerences have
been observed in the gut microbiota of type 2 diabetes individuals which included a moderate degree
of microbial dysbiosis, reduction in the abundance of some universal butyrate-producing bacteria, an
increase in opportunistic pathogens, and an increase in microbial functions conferring oxidative stress
resistance reported an association
between compromised metabolic status, lower gut microbial alpha diversity, and higher representation
of opportunistic pathogens and as a consequence propose that the “gut-heart axis” may be involved
in the very early stages of cardiovascular disease. These studies clearly illustrate the link between
the gut microbiota and metabolic disease of which certain microbial metabolites undoubtedly play a
signiﬁcant role 

The beneﬁcial role of microbially-produced SCFAs in energy regulation of the host, insulin
sensitivity and glucose and lipid metabolism has been presented in numerous studies which have been
the topic of recent reviews  However, certain microbial metabolites have been shown to
be detrimental to health and may be signiﬁcant contributors to the development and progression of
metabolic diseases in the host  Dietary-derived microbial metabolites are of particular interest
given that dietary modulation and probiotic and prebiotic inventions oﬀer viable routes to alter
microbial metabolite signatures.

Trimethylamine (TMA) is a microbial metabolite generated from dietary choline, as well as
the choline derivative betaine, lecithin, and L-carnitine  Red meat, dairy products, eggs and
salt-water fish are rich sources of choline, lecithin and carnitine  Gut microbes known to be
involved in TMA production include members of the families Deferribacteraceae, Anaeroplasmataceae,
Prevotellaceae, and Enterobacteraceae  The microbially-produced TMA crosses the intestinal
epithelial cells, enters the circulation and is transported to the liver where it is converted to the uremic
toxin, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) mainly by the enzyme flavin-containing monooxygenase-3
(FMO3)  Elevated plasma TMAO levels derived from microbial metabolism of the lipid
phosphatidylcholine have been identified as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease in humans 
In the same study, dietary supplementation of mice with TMAO or choline was found to promote
atherosclerosis and studies with germ free mice indicated the significance of the gut microbiota and
dietary choline in TMAO production, increased macrophage cholesterol accumulation and foam cell
formation. Gut microbial-derived production of TMAO from L-carnitine, which is abundant in red
meats, has also been confirmed in humans, suggesting a mechanism for the link between dietary
Interestingly, in the same study dietary
red meat ingestion and accelerated atherosclerosis 

Nutrients 2019, 11, 923

15 of 45

supplementation of mice having intact intestinal microbiota with TMAO was shown to reduce the
expression of key liver enzymes involved in bile acid synthesis, as well as a number of liver bile acid
transporters which resulted in significant decreases in the total bile acid pool and decreased reverse
cholesterol transport. The interaction between consumption of dietary components, TMAO levels and
various disease endpoints may be affected more by interindividual variations in TMAO production than
consumption of the dietary components themselves  Additionally, there is significant variability
in one of the key enzymes (FMO3) involved in TMAO production (can be 20–30× difference between
individuals) making it difficult to generalise and draw conclusions about diet and disease endpoints in
regard to TMAO production. TMAO has also been shown to induce inflammatory markers in mice
and in human aortic endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells owing to activation of the
mitogen-activated protein kinase, extracellular signal kinase, and the NF-κB signalling cascade, and it
promoted recruitment of activated leukocytes to endothelial cells  It has also been shown to activate
the NLRP3 inflammasome  The link between plasma TMAO levels and the gut microbiota in
humans was further confirmed following phosphatidylcholine challenge (ingestion of two hard-boiled
eggs and deuterium [d9]-labelled phosphatidylcholine) in the presence and absence of broad-spectrum
antibiotics whereby plasma TMAO levels were suppressed after antibiotic administration but
reappeared after withdrawal of antibiotics. Furthermore, the study confirmed the link between elevated
TMAO plasma levels and increased risk of incident major adverse cardiovascular events. The metabolite
has also been associated with disease severity and survival of patients with chronic heart failure 
and was shown to cause platelet aggregation in humans receiving a choline supplement for two
months thus revealing a link between TMAO and risk of thrombosis  A systematic review and
meta-analysis of 19 prospective studies found an association between elevated plasma TMAO levels
and its precursors (L-carnitine, choline or betaine) with increased risks of major adverse cardiovascular
events and death, independent of traditional risk factors  Higher plasma TMAO levels were also
found to be associated with diabetes  Interestingly, however, a structural analogue of choline,
namely 3,3-dimethyl-1-butanol (DMB), was able to non-lethally inhibit TMA formation by cultured
microbes, by physiological polymicrobial cultures (intestinal contents, human faeces), and reduce
TMAO levels in mice fed a high carnitine or choline diet  In the same study, DMB also inhibited
choline diet-enhanced endogenous macrophage foam cell formation and development of atherosclerotic
lesions in apolipoprotein e-/- mice without altering circulating cholesterol levels. This study provides a
specific example of a therapeutic approach towards the treatment and prevention of a metabolic disease
through direct manipulation of gut microbiota metabolism.

The aromatic amino acids tyrosine and phenylalanine are metabolised by intestinal bacteria to
the phenolic compound, p-cresol, which is a uremic toxin  This compound is detoxiﬁed
in the liver and colon where it is sulfated to become p-cresol-sulfate  The absence of
p-cresol-sulfate in the plasma of germ-free mice provides further evidence of the role of the gut
microbiota in its production  Under normal conditions p-cresol-sulfate enters the circulation
and ends up in the urine where it is excreted from the body  Information regarding the speciﬁc
intestinal microbes responsible for p-cresol generation is still unclear, but in vitro studies have shown
that members of the following families can produce it; Clostridiaceae, Eubacteriaceae, Lachnospiraceae,
Ruminococcaceae, Staphylococcaceae, Veillonaceae, Bacteroidaceae, Porphyromonadaceae, Biﬁdobacteriaceae,
and Fusobacteriaceae  However, in patients suﬀering from chronic kidney disease, excretion is
impaired. Chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease are closely associated and risk of death
from cardiovascular disease is much higher in patients with end-stage renal disease and evidence
strongly indicates that p-cresol-sulfate is a causal link. p-Cresol-sulfate has been shown to disturb
the normal cell cycle in a mouse preadipocyte cell line, to induce apoptosis, inhibit diﬀerentiation
of preadipocyes to mature adipocytes, and to decrease glucose uptake at baseline and after insulin
stimulation 
It induced shedding of endothelial microparticles in human endothelial cells, a marker of endothelial
It induced oxidative stress in both endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells
damage 

Nutrients 2019, 11, 923

at a concentration representative of that found in dialysis patients, and it increased contraction
of mouse thoracic aorta and eventually led to inward eutrophic remodelling, a feature of uremic
vasculopathy, suggesting it may contribute to hypertension and cardiovascular mortality in chronic
kidney disease  In nephrectomised mice, it promoted cardiac apoptosis which was at least partly
attributed to the induction of NADPH oxidase activity and production of reactive oxygen species 
Poesen et al. showed that intestinal uptake of p-cresol in patients with chronic kidney disease
associated with cardiovascular disease independent of renal function.

Indoxyl sulfate is another uremic toxin derived from gut microbial metabolism of the essential
amino acid, tryptophan  In this case, bacterial trytophanases generate indole from tryptophan
which is transported to the liver where it is hydroxylated and O-sulfated to produce the uremic
toxin. Like p-cresol, serum indoxyl sulfate is problematic for chronic kidney disease patients.
Barreto et al. reported that baseline indoxyl sulfate levels presented an inverse relationship
with renal function and a direct relationship with aortic calciﬁcation in chronic kidney disease patients.
While the causative relationship between indoxyl sulfate and the pathology of cardiovascular disease has
not yet been proven, studies to date suggest its actions are linked to multiple NADPH oxidase-mediated
redox signalling pathways which have been implicated in diﬀerent forms of cardiovascular disease
pathophysiologies, including coronary calciﬁcation, atherosclerotic vascular disease, arrhythmia, and
chronic heart failure  Similarly, the microbial metabolite phenylacetylglutamine, which is derived
from the microbial conversion of phenylalanine  has been shown to be a strong and independent
risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality in chronic kidney disease patients 

The branched chain amino acids (BCAAs), leucine, isoleucine and valine represent three of the nine
essential amino acids. As well as being building blocks of protein synthesis, the BCAAs are involved in
nutrition metabolism, regulation of energy homeostasis, gut health, immunity and disease  Our
gut microbiome has been shown to be enriched with genes involved in the biosynthesis of essential
amino acids, including the BCAAs  While BCAAs are not precisely ‘diet-derived’ microbial
metabolites, a recent study linking microbial BCAAs to glucose intolerance and insulin resistance
renders them worthy of mention. Indeed, Pedersen et al. reported that the serum metabolome
of insulin-resistant individuals was characterised by increased levels of BCAAs which correlated
with a gut microbiome with enriched biosynthetic potential for BCAAs. Transfer of Prevotella copri to
mice, one of the main species driving the association between BCAA synthesis and insulin resistance,
increased circulating levels of BCAAs, induced insulin resistance and aggravated glucose intolerance.
The authors state that further studies are required to determine how the intestinal BCAAs enter the
bloodstream and from what intestinal location. However, elevated circulating BCAA levels and their
breakdown products have been positively associated with insulin resistance in humans. A metabolic
signature related to BCAA catabolism in obese subjects which included circulating BCAAs and
downstream products of their catabolism (acylcarnitines and glutamate) was identiﬁed in “healthy”
obese subjects free of diabetes or other serious illnesses  These obese subjects were also more
insulin resistant compared to their lean counterparts. In the same study, animals fed a high fat diet
supplemented with BCAAs had reduced food intake and weight gain compared to the high fat diet
alone but became equally insulin resistant as those on the high fat diet. The authors proposed a
pathway of dysregulated BCAA metabolism as a result of overnutrition of protein which leads to
insulin resistance, glucose intolerance and eventually type 2 diabetes. A systematic review of 23 studies
involving 20,091 participants found that circulating BCAAs are a useful biomarker for detection of
insulin resistance and diabetic risk later on  A causal role of BCAA metabolism in the aetiology
of type 2 diabetes was reported following a large-scale human genetic and metabolomic study 
Therefore, modulation of the microbiota to inﬂuence BCAA levels could represent a potential route
towards the prevention of insulin resistance and its associated aetiologies.

As we have seen from these studies, metabolomics alongside metagenomics is a powerful tool
towards identifying diet-derived microbial metabolites involved in human disease. These metabolites

Nutrients 2019, 11, 923

not only serve as biomarkers of disease occurrence and disease risk but may provide new routes
towards disease management through modulation of the intestinal microbiota.

6. Role of Diet Type in Shaping the Microbiome

The Mediterranean diet is characterised by high intake of non-refined grains, legumes, and a large
diversity of fresh vegetables and fruits daily; yogurt and milk are consumed only a few times per week;
there is reduced intake of fish and seafood, eggs, white meat and high fat dairy products (a few times per
week); red meat is consumed only a few times per month; alcohol intake is also minimised; dietary lipids
are mainly derived from olive oil  Epidemiological studies and randomized clinical trials have
shown that consumption of a Mediterranean diet bestows protective effects against several diseases,
including obesity, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, stroke, numerous cancers, allergic
diseases, as well as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease (recently reviewed by Tosti et al. . Based
on evidence to date, Tosti et al. concluded that the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet are
due to its lipid-lowering effects, protection provided against inflammation, oxidative stress and platelet
aggregation, modulation of growth factors and hormones involved in cancer pathogenesis, inhibition
of nutrient sensing pathways by specific amino acid restriction and gut microbiota metabolites which
influence host metabolic health. Indeed, the accumulating evidence suggests that the Mediterranean
diet modulates gut microbiota composition and functionality resulting in microbiome and metabolome
which differs from that of the Western diet and reduces risk of disease. For example, consumption
of the Mediterranean diet for one year by obese men (n = 20) significantly decreased the genera
Prevotella and increased Roseburia and Oscillospira  Roseburia is a known butyrate-producer with
immune maintenance and anti-inflammatory properties and Oscillospira is positively associated
with leanness and health  Long-term consumption of the diet also increased the abundance
of Parabacteroides distasonis  a strain recently shown to block colon tumor formation in high fat
diet-fed azoxymethane-treated mice  Faecal metabolite changes linked to amino acid, peptide
and sphingolipid metabolism were reported on the Mediterranean diet and an improvement in insulin
sensitivity was noted  The same group investigated the effect of chronic consumption of the
Mediterranean diet for 2 years in obese patients with severe metabolic disease (n = 33), obese patients
without metabolic dysfunction (n = 32) and non-obese subjects (n = 41)  Obese patients with severe
metabolic disease showed a marked dysbiosis in their gut microbiota which was reversed following
consumption of the Mediterranean diet; furthermore, there was a significant reduction in plasma
triglyceride levels and a trend for glucose depletion in the same group. In this case, consumption
of the Mediterranean diet for two years increased the abundance of Bacteroides and Prevotella which
make up the Bacteriodetes phylum, which has previously been reported to be reduced in obese
In addition, genera with saccharolytic activity, including Faecalibacterium, Roseburia
people 
and Ruminococcus were also increased. Interestingly, such changes were not observed for non-obese
individuals or obese individuals without metabolic syndrome. De Filippis et al. reported that
adherence to the Mediterranean diet in a cohort of Italian individuals (n = 153) was associated with
increased levels of faecal SCFAs which correlated with enrichment of members of Firmicutes and
Bacteroidetes. In contrast, low adherence to the diet (particularly observed in omnivores) was associated
with increased levels of urinary TMAO which correlated with L-Ruminococcus (Ruminococcus genus
assigned to Lachnospiraceae family). Interestingly, the mucin-degrading bacterium Ruminococcus torques
has been shown to be increased in transgenic mice representative of Crohn’s disease and receiving a
high fat/high sugar Western diet  These mice had decreased mucus layer thickness and increased
intestinal permeability. Higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet in a Spanish cohort (n = 74) was
also associated with higher levels of Clostridium cluster XVIa and F. prausnitzii  Clostridium cluster
XVIa contains the Blautia coccoides group which are known butyrate producers  are involved in
secondary bile acid production  F. prausnitzii
is now recognised as one of the most abundant butyrate producers in the human gut microbiota and has
anti-inflammatory properties reported that fast food consumption

Nutrients 2019, 11, 923

18 of 45

in an adult population resulted in a microbiota with suppressed representation of Lactobacillus and
butyrate-producing bacteria while adherence to the Mediterranean diet led to lower faecal E. coli
counts, a higher Bifidobacterium: E. coli ratio and greater molar ratio of acetate (n = 120). The study also
reported increased levels and prevalence of Candida albicans due to the Mediterranean diet which the
authors suggest could be linked to the ingestion of foodstuffs that are carriers of yeast. Overall, the
studies presented here strongly indicate that increased SCFA production as a result of gut microbiota
modulation on the Mediterranean diet plays a key role in its beneficial health effects.

Another “trendy” diet type that shapes the microbiome is the gluten-free diet. De Palma et al. 
showed that a 30-day gluten-free diet decreased populations of Biﬁdobacterium and Lactobacillus while
increasing unhealthy bacteria, such as E. coli and Enterobacetriaceae that could further increase the risk
of infection by opportunistic bacteria. Others, such as Bonder et al. found reductions in R. bromii
and Roseburia faecis coupled to increased Victivallaceae and Clostridiaceae in individuals consuming
a gluten-free diet. Whilst a gluten-free diet is an eﬀective therapy for treating patients diagnosed
with celiac disease it is often associated with a number of health issues and nutritional deﬁciencies.
Interestingly, over the last 5–10 years, there has been an increasing number of healthy, non-celiac
individuals following gluten-free diets and do so under the impression that such a diet is healthier
for them when paradoxically it may be increasing their risk of the similar health issues and nutrient
deﬁciencies as those commonly seen in those with celiac disease.

7. Dietary Components (Protein, Carbohydrate, Fat) Inﬂuencing Microbiota Composition

Protein, carbohydrate and fat are macronutrients required in large amounts to maintain bodily
functions and to provide energy for the body. FAO/WHO recommends that daily dietary fat should
not exceed 30% of total energy intake, protein should account for 10–15%, and carbohydrate should
account for the remainder (between 55–75%). Dietary ﬁbre intake is recommended at 25 g/day for
women and 38 g per day for men  However, the proportions of these macronutrients in the typical
Western diet are skewed towards high-energy and low nutrient-dense foods containing large amounts
of saturated fat and sugar, and ﬁbre intake has been reported to be as low as 15 g/day in 90% of the
population in developed countries  Furthermore, each of these macronutrients contains diﬀerent
types and studies have shown that these diﬀerences along with quantity consumed can dramatically
inﬂuence gut microbiota composition and functionality.

7.1. Fat

Dietary fat is composed mainly of triglycerides where each triglyceride molecule contains a
glycerol backbone with three fatty acids attached  Some dietary fats reach the colon after escaping
absorption in the small intestine. Indeed, we have already seen that an animal-based diet high in
fat and protein alters the gut microbiota resulting in an increase in the abundance of bile-tolerant
microorganisms, such as Bilophila, Alistipes and Bacteroides and long-term consumption selects for
a Bacteroides enterotype directly investigated if typically consumed
dietary fatty acids alone could sustain the growth of the human gut microbiota using an in vitro
multi-vessel simulator system of the human small intestine. Switching from a balanced Western
diet type medium to one lacking carbohydrates and proteins resulted in substantial changes to the
microbiota and metabolites produced. Several speciﬁc genera increased in abundance, including
Alistipes, Bilophila and several genera within the class Gammaproteobacteria. Increased abundance
of Alistipes has been correlated with a greater frequency of pain in paediatric patients with irritable
bowel syndrome and has been
associated with type 2 diabetes  We have already seen that Bil. wadsworthia was increased in
humans consuming the animal-based diet and is associated with inﬂammation owing to its
hydrogen sulﬁde-producing capabilities  E. coli is a member of Gammaproteobacteria which
also harbours many pathogenic members, including Salmonella, Yersinia, Vibrio, and Pseudomonas 
The abundances of well known glycan and protein degraders, including Bacteroides, Clostridium and

Nutrients 2019, 11, 923

Roseburia decreased in the fats-only medium and there was also a decrease in the production of
antioxidants and SCFAs, a concomitant decrease in the abundance of glycan-degradation genes, and an
increase in the abundance of genes coding for fatty acid degradation enzymes and anaerobic respiratory
reductases  Overall, the results show that the gut microbiota is capable of utilising dietary fats
typical of the Western diet but the resulting changes may negatively impact human health. In mice,
Murphy et al. showed that high fat feeding of mice was more inﬂuential for altering gut microbiota
composition than genetically induced obesity, generating a progressive increase in Firmicutes which
reached statistical signiﬁcance. In another study, high fat feeding of mice was shown to decrease the
proportion of Ruminococcaceae, which are known to utilise plant polysaccharides, and to increase the
proportion of Rikenellaceae  of which the genus Alistipes is a member. The results also suggested
that high fat feeding altered overall cellular composition within the abundant bacterial groups, namely,
Bacteroidales and Lachnospiraceae based on cecal chemical ﬁngerprints analysis. Metaproteome analysis
revealed a decrease in proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism and a shift towards amino acid
and simple sugar metabolism. This is in agreement with Yatsunenko et al. who reported that
metagenomes associated with the Western diet are enriched in amino acid and simple sugar degrading
enzymes relative to African populations consuming diets rich in complex carbohydrates. More recently,
Vaughn et al. reported that a high fat diet fed to Sprague-Dawley rats increased the Firmicutes:
Bacteriodetes ratio and increased proliferation of pro-inﬂammatory Proteobacteria which were found to
be toxic to vagal aﬀerent neurons in culture. Overall, the results suggest that high fat-diet-induced
shifts in gut microbiota could disrupt vagal gut-brain communication ultimately leading to increased
accumulation of body fat.

However, dietary fat is not a homogenous macronutrient, since the structure and function of
diﬀerent fatty acids can vary greatly depending on chain length and absence or
presence of carbon-carbon double bonds  Saturated fatty acids (SFAs) have no double bond,
monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) contain a single double bond, while polyunsaturated fatty
acids (PUFAs) have two or more double bonds. Furthermore, the double bond can be in a cis or
trans conﬁguration depending on whether the hydrogens attached to the carbons in the double
bond are on the same side or opposing sides of the molecule, respectively. Trans fats are produced
commercially by the partial hydrogenation of unsaturated fats or naturally via biohydrogenation in
ruminant animals  Studies have shown that diﬀerent fatty acids exert diﬀerential eﬀects on
the gut microbiota. For example, a high fat diet rich in saturated fat in the form of palm oil (PUFA:
SFA ratio = 0.4) induced higher body weight gain and liver triglyceride content in mice compared
with diets rich in polyunsaturated fats (olive oil, PUFA: SFA ratio = 1.1, or saﬄower oil, PUFA: SFA
ratio = 7.8)  Interestingly, the overﬂow of dietary fat to the distal intestine was greater on the
palm oil diet compared with the others. Indeed, the high-saturated fat, palm oil diet reduced microbial
diversity and increased the Firmicutes: Bacteroidetes ratio which the authors suggest may be due to
antimicrobial eﬀects of the saturated fats. A diet high in SFAs derived from milk fat, but not PUFAs
derived from saﬄower oil, promoted expansion of the low abundance sulﬁte-reducing Bil. wadsworthia
in mice which was associated with a pro-inﬂammatory immune response and increased incidence
of colitis in genetically susceptible mice, but not wild type mice  Due to their hydrophobicity,
milk fats promote taurine-conjugation of hepatic bile acids which increases the availability of organic
sulfur for use by bacteria, such as Bil. wadsworthia. In the same study, both the SFA- and PUFA-rich
diets reduced microbiota richness compared with a low-fat diet. In this case, the low-fat diet promoted
Firmicutes while the two high fat diets resulted in higher abundances of Bacteroidetes and low levels
of Firmicutes. Interestingly, mice fed high fat diets derived from milk fat, or lard (both high in SFAs),
or saﬄower oil (high in PUFAs) revealed that all three high fat diets induced dramatic and speciﬁc
changes to gut microbiota composition which were associated with diﬀerent host adipose tissue
inﬂammatory/lipogenic proﬁles  Saﬄower oil is rich in omega-6 PUFAs which are associated
with a pro-inﬂammatory status  Indeed, the saﬄower oil-rich diet resulted in a greater localized,
tissue-speciﬁc pro-inﬂammatory eﬀect compared to the milk fat and lard-based diets  However,

Nutrients 2019, 11, 923

in both milk fat- and saﬄower oil-fed mice, Tenericutes were decreased, a phylum which has been
shown to be reduced under inﬂammatory conditions and Proteobacteria was increased, of
which Bil. wadsworthia is a member. Consumption of extra virgin olive oil (rich in MUFAs and phenolic
compounds), reﬁned olive oil (rich in MUFAs but low in phenolic compounds), or butter (rich in
SFAs and cholesterol) by mice resulted in diﬀerential eﬀects on gut microbiota composition 
The butter-induced changes resembled those reported for obese individuals while the changes induced
by extra virgin olive oil diﬀered most from butter. In a more recent study, the same group investigated
the eﬀect of extra virgin olive oil on mouse gut microbiota compared to butter using more in-depth
analysis  Highest levels of systolic blood pressure were recorded for mice fed butter which
correlated positively with Desulfovibrio sequences in faeces, which were signiﬁcantly higher in mice fed
butter compared to olive oil. Interestingly, Desulfovibrionaceae are sulfate reducers, which the authors
suggest could be sustained by butter sulfate sources, whereas the authors suggest that the lower
levels in the olive oil diet may be due to the higher presence of polyphenols. Olive oil had the lowest
plasmatic insulin levels which correlated inversely with Desulfovibrio, and the lowest plasmatic leptin
values which correlated inversely with Sutterellaceae, Marispirillum and Mucilaginibacter dageonensis
which were signiﬁcantly higher for olive oil. Mice fed the standard diet had the lowest total cholesterol
levels which correlated positively with Fusicatenibacter and Prevotella, the latter of which has been
associated with an improvement in glucose metabolism but its relationship with cholesterol is
less clear  Interestingly, butter was also associated with an increase in Alistipes indictintus and
Pontibacter lucknowensis which correlated positively with total cholesterol, ghrelin, insulin, body weight
and HDL/LDL. Lam et al. reported a rapid increase of hydrogen sulﬁde-producing bacteria
in mice consuming a diet high in saturated fat which was not observed for mice fed high fat diets
containing omega-6 or omega-3 PUFAs. In fact, these bacteria remained relatively stable in mice fed
omega-6 PUFAs and were mostly reduced in mice fed omega-3 PUFAs. Likewise, Shen et al. 
reported that mice fed a diet high in saturated fat had a greater abundance of three types of sulﬁdogenic
bacteria (Bil. wadsworthia, Desulfobulbus and Desulfovibrio) primarily in the colonic mucosa compared
to mice fed a low-fat diet after chronic feeding  In addition, high fat feeding increased
intestinal inﬂammation by week 20, which was not observed at week 6. However, by week 6, high fat
feeding had impaired the localization of the tight junction protein zonula occludens 1 at the apical area
of the ileal epithelium which was also observed at week 20. The authors concluded that chronic high
saturated fat feeding may contribute to chronic intestinal inﬂammation owing to microbial metabolic
pathways. In humans at risk of metabolic syndrome, a high saturated fat diet, a high MUFA diet
combined with high glycemic index (GI) carbohydrates, or a high MUFA diet combined with low GI
carbohydrates caused a decrease in total bacteria and the high saturated fat diet increased faecal SCFA
concentrations which the authors suggest could be due to lower absorption in the gut 

Interestingly, transgenic mice constitutively producing omega 3-PUFAs fed a high fat/high sucrose
diet displayed higher phylogenetic diversity in the cecum compared to wild-type mice fed the
same diet  The transgenic mice were protected from obesity, glucose intolerance and hepatic
steatosis and maintained a normal gut barrier function unlike wild-type mice. Transplantation of
the faecal microbiota from the transgenic mice to the wild-type mice reversed their weight gain and
normalised their glucose tolerance and intestinal permeability. The authors concluded that the omega-3
mediated changes to the gut microbiota were involved in the prevention of metabolic syndrome in the
transgenic mice.

Trans fats contain unsaturated fatty acids with at least one double bond in the trans configuration.
In industry, they are formed during the partial hydrogenation of unsaturated fats (vegetable oils),
a process performed to generate semi-solid fats for use in commercial cooking, margarines and
manufacturing processes  These fats, also referred to as partially hydrogenated oils (PHOs) have a
long shelf life and can be customised to enhance palatability of sweets and baked goods and thus are
an attractive ingredient for food manufacturers  However, their consumption is associated with
increased risk of disease, such as cardiovascular disease  and Alzheimer’s

Nutrients 2019, 11, 923

disease investigated the impact of PHOs on gut microbiota in mice in the
presence of whey protein hydrolysate or casein as a protein source. The PHOs had minimal impact on
the gut microbiota and were hardly able to invert the Bacteroidetes: Firmicutes ratio but preserved the
normal pattern.

Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is a collective term describing isomers of linoleic acid (LA) and
while the latter has double bonds in the cis conﬁguration located at carbons 9 and 12, CLA can
have either the cis or trans conﬁguration or both located along the carbon chain  Unlike the
trans fats described earlier, CLA has been associated with numerous beneﬁcial properties based
primarily on results from animal models and cell lines, including protection against cancer, obesity and
atherosclerosis, as well as immunomodulation which has been reviewed by Yang et al.  The most
bioactive isomers of CLA are cis-9, trans-11 CLA and trans-10, cis-12 CLA  Supplementing
mice with dietary trans-10, cis-12 CLA for eight weeks resulted in signiﬁcantly lower proportions
of Firmicutes and higher proportions of Bacteroidetes compared with the control group which
received no supplementation  Gut microbiota composition was signiﬁcantly altered with higher
proportions of the family Porphyromonadaceae and decreased abundance of families Lachnospiraceae
and Desulfovibrionaceae. Porphyromonadaceae has been associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
(NAFLD) in mice  The family has also
been associated with cognitive impairment in cirrhosis patients, whereas Lachnospiraceae abundance
was reported to be lower in cirrhosis patients  Lachnospiraceae has also been shown to protect
mice against C. diﬃcile colonisation and most recently has been suggested to play a protective
role against colorectal cancer  Desulfovibrionaceae contains the sulﬁte-reducing species Bil.
Wadsworthia. Desulfovibrionaceae has also been associated with impaired glucose tolerance and most
serious metabolic syndrome phenotypes in mice  Thus, the results of the study indicate that
gut microbiota alterations following long-term supplementation of the trans-10, cis-12 CLA isomer
could be detrimental to health. However, given that CLA supplements are commercially available,
the authors suggest that fatty acid mixtures with equal proportions of CLA isomers or probiotics and
prebiotics may balance such negative eﬀects 

In a recent review investigating the available evidence on the impact of dietary fat on
the gut microbiota and low-grade systemic inﬂammation and clinical implications for obesity,
Cândido et al. concluded that high fat diets and saturated fat should be avoided, while MUFAs
and omega-3 PUFAs should be encouraged in order to regulate gut microbiota and inﬂammation
towards promoting control of body weight/fat.

The ketogenic diet, deﬁned as a high fat and low carbohydrate diet, has been eﬀectively used as a
therapeutic treatment for a number of neurological disorders, including epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease,
Parkinson’s disease, depression, autism, traumatic brain injury and depression, as examples 
Recently, researchers have revealed that the protective eﬀects of the ketogenic diet could be mediated
via the gut microbiota based on studies in mice  The ketogenic diet administered by
Ma et al. consisted of 75.1% fat composed of SFAs, MUFAs and PUFAs. Following 16 weeks
on the diet, mice revealed several neurovascular enhancements with potential to reduce the risk of
Alzheimer’s disease which could be associated with the observed gut microbiota changes which
included an increase in beneﬁcial bacteria, including Akkermansia muciniphila and Lactobacillus and a
reduction in pro-inﬂammatory microbes Desulfovibrio and Turicibacter. The gut microbiota changes
observed by Olson et al. in mice receiving the ketogenic diet were found to be required for the
protective eﬀects of the diet against acute electrically induced seizures and spontaneous tonic-clonic
seizures. In this case, Akkermansia and Parabacteriodes were signiﬁcantly increased and enrichment of,
and gnotobiotic colonisation with these microorganisms were capable of restoring seizure protection
in germ-free mice or mice treated with antibiotics. Additionally, in a mouse model of glioma, mice fed
the ketogenic diet had slightly increased survival compared to mice fed the control diet and showed
signiﬁcant diﬀerences in several key microorganisms  The ketogenic diet generally includes fats

Nutrients 2019, 11, 923

22 of 45

of all chain lengths thus increases in blood ketone levels could be responsible for the observed
gut microbiota changes 

7.2. Protein

It has been estimated that up to 25 g of protein, peptides and free amino acids enter the colon on a
daily basis  Colonic microbial digestion of these materials generates a range of end products,
including SCFAs, indoles, amines, phenols, thiols, hydrogen sulﬁde, CO2 and H2, some of which are
essential for health maintenance and some of which are detrimental  Studies investigating the
direct impact of protein on gut microbiota composition and functionality have shown that protein
quantity, quality, processing history (which impacts on protein digestion, presentation and overall
function) and source must be taken into consideration. For example, a high protein diet (45% protein,
30% carbohydrate) fed to Wistar rats had detrimental eﬀects on the colonic microbiota compared
to a normal protein diet  Streptococcus, E. coli/Shigella, and
Enterococcus increased by 5.36 fold, 54.9-fold, and 31.3 fold, respectively, on the high protein diet, whose
abundances correlated positively with genes and metabolites associated with disease pathogenesis,
including the metabolite cadaverine, which is derived from decarboxylation of lysine and in high
amounts has been shown to induce oxidative stress and DNA damage  Sulfate-reducing bacteria
increased by 2.59 fold which correlated with increased sulﬁde. There was also an increase in spermine
which has been shown to be extremely toxic in rats  The following bacteria, which are generally
regarded as being beneﬁcial, decreased in abundance on the high protein diet, including the butyrate
producer F. prausnitzii (by 3.5 fold), Ruminococcus (by 8.04 fold) which contains butyrate producers,
and the mucin degrader Akkermansia (not detected in high protein diet group). A. muciniphila is
considered to be a health promoting bacterium  On the high protein diet, butyrate decreased
by 2.16 fold. This diet was also associated with a decrease in genes involved in innate immunity,
O-linked glycosylation of mucin, and oxidative phosphorylation.

Protein source or type has also been shown to impact gut microbiota composition, given that the
amino acid composition diﬀers between types. A 14-day feeding trial in rats fed either protein from
soy, pork, beef, chicken, ﬁsh and casein, (the latter served as a control) revealed changes by day 2
particularly between red meat (pork and beef) and white meat (ﬁsh and chicken). Principal component
analysis revealed distinct microbiota on days 7 and 14, whereby the soy protein group was separate
from the meat and casein groups  In another similar study, soy protein was associated with
increased faecal SCFAs in rats compared to rats fed white meat, red meat or casein  The soy group
also had a higher relative abundance of Bacteroides and Prevotella which are the major propionate and
other SCFA producers  Lactobacillus, a genus known for its beneﬁcial eﬀects was increased in the
gut microbiota by ingestion of meat proteins. In this study, the diets clustered into two subgroups at the
phylum level, the ‘meat class’ and the ‘non-meat class.’ In another study, soy fed hamsters were found
to have a more consistently diverse microbiota in the small and lower intestine compared to hamsters
fed milk protein isolate and the largest diﬀerences were found within the Bacteriodetes phylum 
Indeed, the milk protein isolate fed group had a greater relative abundance of Bacteroidaceae and
Porphyromonadaceae compared to the soy fed groups. Those fed partially hydrolyzed soy protein
isolate revealed a bloom of Biﬁdobacteriaceae across most intestinal sections and a higher proportion of
Clostridiales spp. in the cecum compared to the milk protein isolate fed group. Biﬁdobacteria are well
known beneﬁcial microbes and commensal members of Clostridiales are now known to be involved in
maintenance of overall gut function  The milk protein isolate fed group had a greater abundance of
Erysipelotrichacaea in ileum and faecal samples which has been associated with dyslipidemic phenotypes
in humans  Plasma lipids were signiﬁcantly reduced in the soy fed hamsters
compared to those that received milk protein isolate, owing at least in part to the gut microbiota changes
induced by soy protein  Under a high fat diet regime, soybean protein isolate reduced high fat
diet induced weight gain and adipose tissue mass accumulation and attenuated hepatic steatosis in
mice which was not observed for dairy protein  An increased cecal bile acid pool was observed

Nutrients 2019, 11, 923

23 of 45

in the soybean group with an elevated secondary: primary bile acid ratio, along with an enhancement
in the secretion of GLP-1. This was accompanied by an expansion of taxa proposed to be involved
in bile acid biotransformation. These eﬀects were abolished in germ free mice suggesting that the
metabolic beneﬁts of soy protein are due to the microbiota alterations which bring about increased bile
acid transformation and secretion of GLP-1. Likewise, tartary buckwheat protein proved capable of
preventing dyslipidemia in mice fed a high fat diet which was not observed for casein  The buck
wheat protein inhibited the growth of E. coli and promoted the growth of Lactobacillus, Enterococcus and
Biﬁdobacterium, the latter of which was closely related to plasma lipids. Excretion of total bile acids
and SCFAs were signiﬁcantly increased in faeces from mice fed buckwheat. Mungbean protein also
proved superior to casein in reducing high fat diet induced weight gain in mice  The mungbean
protein caused elevated secretion of GLP-1, an increase in the cecal and faecal bile acid pool with a
dramatically elevated secondary: primary bile acid ratio; eﬀects which were abolished in germ free
mice. In terms of the gut microbiota, mungbean consumption as part of the high fat diet resulted in
an expansion of Ruminococcaceae, a family known to have BSH activity and caused an increase
in taxa belonging to the Bacteroidetes phylum and a decrease in the abundance of Firmicutes 
Whey protein extract has been shown to increase diversity, Biﬁdobacterium and Lactobacillus populations
while decreasing Bacteroides and Clostridia  Similarly, pea protein extract has been shown to
increase diversity, Biﬁdobacterium and Lactobacillus populations  These studies clearly suggest that
plant-derived proteins are superior to animal-derived proteins for promoting a beneﬁcial microbiota
with positive eﬀects on host metabolism.

Interestingly in humans, a three-week isocaloric supplementation with casein, soy protein or
maltodextrin, which served as control, had no impact on the gut microbiota but altered bacterial
metabolite production  Compared to maltodextrin, both soy protein and casein caused a decrease
in faecal butyrate which the authors suggest may be due to the combination of an increase in protein
intake and a decrease in indigestible carbohydrate intake. Amino acid metabolites increased on the
high protein diet owing to protein degradation by the gut microbiota. These metabolites included
the faecal concentration of 2-methylbutyrate and the urinary concentration of the host-microbiota
co-metabolites phenylacetylglutamine and indoxyl sulfate. Casein speciﬁcally increased p-cresol
sulfate. Transcriptome analysis of rectal biopsies revealed changes in gene expression associated with
mucosal homeostasis maintenance on the two protein diets, albeit the transcriptome proﬁles diﬀered
between the two, which the authors suggest is due to exposure to diﬀerent bacterial metabolites
resulting from the diﬀerent proteins. However, mucosal inﬂammation was not induced on these
diets and faecal water cytotoxicity was not altered either. The authors suggest that high protein diets
should be considered with some caution given the changes observed in gene expression in the rectal
mucosa and that protein source must also be taken into account. More recently, a low protein diet
for six months was reported to reduce serum uremic toxin levels, including p-cresol
sulfate, in non-dialysis, chronic kidney disease patients  DGGE indicated a change in the intestinal
microbiota proﬁle. The low protein diet was also associated with an improvement in renal function and
a reduction in total and LDL cholesterol. A position paper by the MyNewGut Study group analysed
PubMed-referenced publications involving human intervention studies to clarify beneﬁcial versus
deleterious eﬀects of high protein diets on metabolic and gut related health parameters, including
interactions with the gut microbiota  The study concluded that high protein diets are generally
associated with decreased body weight and improvement in blood metabolic parameters but they also
modify various bacterial metabolites and co-metabolites in faecal and urinary contents. The eﬀects
on the gut microbiota were heterogeneous depending on the type of dietary intervention. The eﬀects
of high protein diets on the gut microbiota were dependent on protein source (plant versus animal)
and this should be considered for future investigations and some caution should be exercised around
high protein diets, particularly as long-term or recurrent dietary practices. Note: Processing of
protein, including thermal processing, and its impact on protein function, including modulation of the
microbiome is not fully understood and requires further investigation.

7.3. Carbohydrates

24 of 45

The quantity of dietary carbohydrates entering the colon each day has been estimated at
approximately 40 g  We have already seen that a carbohydrate-rich diet (ﬁbre and plant-derived
polysaccharides) results in a microbiota which is dominated by the Prevotella enterotype and
is enriched in polysaccharide degrading members with increased SCFA production 
However, dietary carbohydrates which enter the colon can be categorised as resistant starch, non-starch
polysaccharides, oligosaccharides, as well as some di- and monosaccharides  and as with the other
macronutrients, amount and type of carbohydrate has an impact on the gut microbiota. Resistant starch
is an important non-digestible carbohydrate, of which there are four types, (RS1 to RS4)  A diet
high in type 3 resistant starch for 10 weeks was found to stimulate the growth of Firmicutes bacteria
related to R. bromii and Eub. rectales in human volunteers  both of which possess amylolytic
activity  Biﬁdobacterium spp.
were found to increase dramatically in one volunteer in response to the resistant starch used in this
diet. In contrast, non-starch polysaccharides (wheat bran) presented little evidence of changes to
the faecal microbiota, which the authors state may be attributable to the smaller increase achieved
for non-starch polysaccharides compared to a 4.8 fold increase in resistant starch 
Interestingly, of the 14 volunteers, >60% of the resistant starch remained undigested in two compared to
<4% in the remaining 12 volunteers highlighting the signiﬁcance of the initial microbiota composition.
Martínez et al. revealed that resistant starch types 3 and 4 diﬀerentially aﬀected the microbiota in
human volunteers following consumption of each for three weeks in a double-blind cross-over study.
In this case, resistant starch type 4 induced changes at the phylum level resulting in a decrease in
Firmicutes and an increase in Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes. At the species level, resistant starch
type 4 increased Bif. adolescentis and Para. distasonis. In three subjects, resistant starch type 4 induced
a 10-fold increase in biﬁdobacteria. Resistant starch type 2 signiﬁcantly increased R. bromii and Eub.
rectales compared to resistant starch type 4. Importantly, the responses to the resistant starches and their
magnitudes varied between individuals but were reversible and tightly associated with resistant starch
consumption. This interindividual variation was also reported by Venkataraman et al.  In this
case, resistant starch type 2 increased faecal butyrate in a cohort of 20 young healthy individuals but
responses varied widely such that individuals could be categorised into three groups based on butyrate
levels before and during resistant starch consumption: enhanced, high, and low. In the enhanced
group, faecal butyrate increased by an average of 67% which coincided with a dramatic increase in the
relative abundance of resistant starch-degrading organisms, including Bif. adolescentis or R. bromii in
most individuals (increasing from 2% to 9%) and Eub. rectales in almost half of these individuals. In the
high group, levels of butyrate remained the same before and during resistant starch consumption.
In this group, resistant starch-degrading microorganisms increased in abundance, suggesting the
resistant starch was degraded, but there was no concomitant increase in butyrate levels which the
authors suggest may be due to these individuals experiencing a plateau eﬀect owing to the fact that
they are performing well in terms of butyrate production. In the low group, butyrate levels were low
before resistant starch consumption began and did not improve during the trial. The resistant starch
degrading bacteria in the low group did not increase from an initial abundance of ~1.5% suggesting
their microbiota did not degrade the resistant starch which the authors state may be due to the presence
of antagonistic microbes or lack of synergistic microbes. More recently, Vital et al. reported
that distinct parts of the microbiota work together to degrade resistant starch (type 2 in this study)
and successively form health-promoting end products. In this case, resistant starch degradation was
governed by Firmicutes whereby R. bromii degradation of the resistant starch provided fermentation
substrates and increased acetate concentrations to support the growth of major butyrate producers.
H2-scavenging sulphite reducers and acetogens also increased. Again, the individual responses varied
with the observed pattern reported for seven of the twelve participants, while four showed mixed
responses and one individual remained unresponsive.

Using an in vitro approach based on isothermal microcalorimetry in conjunction with Illumina
Miseq sequencing of the faecal microbiota and metabolite proﬁling, Adamberg et al. compared
the impact of diﬀerent oligo- and polysaccharides (galacto- and fructooligosaccharides, resistant starch,
levan, inulin, arabinogalactan, xylan, pectin and chitin), as well as a glycoprotein mucin, representing
an indigenous substrate, on the growth and metabolism of the faecal microbiota. Apart from chitin,
more than 70% of all substrates were fermented by the faecal microbiota with total heat generation
up to 8 J/mL. Overall, the diﬀerent ﬁbre types supported the growth of speciﬁc microbiota and
diﬀerent metabolic routes. Arabinogalactan stimulated the growth of several health-promoting genera,
including Biﬁdobacterium, Bacteroides, Coprococcus and Lachnoclostridium. Propionic acid was enhanced
by arabinogalactin, xylan and mucin but not by galacto-, fructooligosaccharides or inulin. Fermentation
of mucin resulted in the generation of acetate, propionate and the highest amount of butyrate
and supported the growth of species from the following genera, Clostridium, Lachnoclostridium and
Parabacteroides. The authors suggest that only a diverse spectrum of glycans in the diet can contribute
to a diverse microbiota. Chung et al. determined the impact of growth substrate complexity and
multiplicity on species diversity of the human colonic microbiota in vitro whereby anaerobic fermenters
were supplied continuously with single carbohydrates (arabinoxylanoligosaccharide, pectin or inulin),
or with a mix of all three, or a mix of all three plus resistant starch, β-glucan and galacto-mannon
as energy sources. Over the ﬁrst six days, inulin supported less microbial diversity than the other
single carbohydrates, the mix of three, or the mix of six carbohydrates. While the communities did
not diﬀer substantially at phylum and family levels, marked diﬀerences were observed at species
level. The overall results strongly suggest that strategies to increase microbial diversity should employ
complex nondigestible substrates mixtures.

Few studies have investigated the impact of high sugar containing diets on the microbiota.
However, recently, Sen et al. investigated the impact of high fat/high sugar (sucrose), low fat/high
sugar and low fat/low sugar diets on Sprague-Dawley rats. As expected, both the high fat/high
sugar and low fat/high sugar diets for four weeks caused signiﬁcant increases in body weight and
body fat compared to the low fat/low sugar diet. The high sugar and high fat diets resulted in gut
microbiota dysbiosis which was characterised by an overall decrease in microbial diversity, a bloom
in clostridia and bacilli and a marked decrease in Lactobacillus species. There was also an increase
in the Firmicutes: Bacteriodetes ratio. Speciﬁcally, the low fat/high sugar diet caused an increase
in two Proteobacteria members, namely Sutterella and Bilophila. The high sugar diet also induced
gut inﬂammation and triggered a remodelling of the gut brain axis  In mice, a high sugar
(sucrose) diet increased Clostridiales belonging to the Firmicutes phylum which was also observed
for the high fat diet  The high sugar diet also caused a decrease in the order Bacteroidales
which belongs to Bacteroidetes. Lactobacillales was also signiﬁcantly increased on the high sugar
diet. Thus, overall the high sugar diet altered more bacterial orders and genera than the high fat
diet. The increase in Clostridiales and decrease in Bacteroidales on the high sugar diet was related to
poor cognitive ﬂexibility. Di Luccia et al. reported that a high fructose diet induced markers of
metabolic syndrome, inﬂammation and oxidative stress in rats, but these were signiﬁcantly reduced
when the animals were treated with antibiotics or faecal samples from control rats fed a standard diet.
Since the number of members from the genera Coprococcus and Ruminococcus were increased by the
high fructose diet but reduced by antibiotics and faecal transplant, the results suggest a correlation
between their abundance and metabolic syndrome.

8. Conclusions

The link between nutrition, the gut microbiota and health has been expounded in the multitude
of studies published in recent years. Long-term dietary habits appear to have the most profound
inﬂuence on the quality of the gut microbiota and hence its eﬃcacy to the human body. In this regard,
healthy eating patterns with adequate fruits and vegetables, ensuring a rich source of dietary ﬁbre,
along with healthy fats (MUFAs and PUFAs) and a trend towards more plant-derived proteins should

help promote gut microbiota diversity and functionality enabling it to eﬀectively serve its host. But as
countries become more industrialised and range of choice expands, including foods available for
consumption, consumers tend to eat for taste-satisfaction and/or convenience at the cost of nutritional
value in many instances. Furthermore, not everyone responds eﬀectively to dietary interventions
aimed at improving health. The consequence of this has been an alarming surge in non-communicable
diseases, including cancer and metabolic-related diseases. Understanding the speciﬁc role of the gut
microbiota in the diet-health sequence has enabled scientists and nutritionists to further comprehend
how diet speciﬁcally impacts health at the individual level and why dietary interventions do not
always serve everyone equally. Thus, modiﬁcation of the gut microbiota through diet, probiotics and
prebiotics may oﬀer viable opportunities for preventing many of these ‘Western-associated’ diseases,
particularly in the case of metabolic-related diseases for which microbiota quality and quantity can
be an essential aspect. Indeed, Part II of this review looks at the eﬃcacy of such interventions in
terms of over/under nutrition. We also explore opportunities for optimising health at diﬀerent life
stages (elderly in nursing homes, during pregnancy, physically active individuals and those in high
stress environments) through improved diet and interventions. In this regard, microbiome testing
at the individual level has a signiﬁcant role to play in interpreting how an individual responds to
dietary components and what interventions should be undertaken to improve those responses for a
healthier outcome, thus underpinning the very goal of precision nutrition. In Part II of this review, we
also look at speciﬁc examples of how the microbiota is already being used as a biomarker to predict
responsiveness to speciﬁc dietary constituents and highlight further research which is necessary to
make precision nutrition through the microbiome a reality.
