Gut Microbiome in Human Health

INTRODUCTION

The human microbiome comprises of collective genomes of
microbiota inhabiting us, namely protozoa, archaea, eukaryotes,
viruses and predominantly bacteria that live symbiotically on and
within various sites of the human body. Examples of occupied
habitats include our oral cavity, genital organs, respiratory tract,
skin and gastrointestinal system (Lloyd-Price et al., 2016). The
human microbiota is estimated to be ∼1013–1014 microbial
cells, with around 1:1 microbial cells to human cells ratio
(Sender et al., 2016). These numbers are derived from the
total bacterial cells in colon  the organ
that harbors the densest number of microbes (Sender et al.,
2016). The diverse gastrointestinal microbiota is predominantly
composed of bacteria from three major phyla, namely Firmicutes,
Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria (Tap et al., 2009). This diverse
and complex microbiome serves as a functional expansion of
host genomes, and is estimated to harbor 50- to 100-fold
more genes, compared to the host. These extra genes have
added various types of enzymatic proteins which were non-
encoded by the host, and play a critical role in facilitating
host metabolism, thus contributing to the regulation of host
physiology (Hooper and Gordon, 2001). Until recent decades, the
properties of the human microbiome and the host–microbiota
interactions have been largely unknown due to technology
limitations especially in examining non-cultivable microbes
of interest, and lack of population-scale data depicting the
microbiota compositions and functions. However, advances in
sequencing technologies and subsequent large-scale sequence-
based microbiome projects such as the Human Microbiome

(HMP) consortium funded by The United States
Project
National Institutes of Health (NIH), as well as the MetaHIT
(Metagenomics of the Human Intestinal Tract) consortium
funded by the European Commission, have served as catalysts
in nourishing research on the human microbiome. These large-
scale endeavors both share similar missions in characterizing
the human microbiome and their roles in health and disease
states, with MetaHIT solely focusing on gut microbiome.
Several analyses have been incorporated in these meta-omics
projects including 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing to
taxonomically characterize the microbiota communities; Whole
Genome Shotgun (WGS) metagenomic sequencing of body-site
speciﬁc whole community DNA, followed by reference genome
mapping, metagenomic assembly, gene cataloging and metabolic
reconstruction, to facilitate maximal capture of organismal and
functional data of human microbiota (The Human Microbiome
Project Consortium, 2012).

Due to the inherent complexity and heterogeneity of the
human microbiome, experiments are required to counteract the
limitation of empirical methods in examining the causation or
correlation links between microbiota disequilibrium (dysbiosis)
and human diseases. Robust experimental modeling enables
systematic manipulation of variables to investigate hypotheses
deduced from “omics” studies. For this, the application of
‘humanized’ gnotobiotic animal model that harbors deﬁned
collection of sequenced microbial communities, has gained
momentum in recent years in microbiome research (Faith
et al., 2010). This allows proof-of-mechanism study to examine
the potential
(Turnbaugh et al., 2009b),
antibiotic, environmental toxicants (Stedtfeld et al., 2017) and
host genotypic variation (Ley et al., 2005) on the microbiota and
disease manifestation, due to changes in microbiota composition,
transcriptomes, proteomes or metabolomes post-induced
variations can be extracted and characterized to understand the
operation of the microbiota. Besides, ‘humanized’ gnotobiotic
mice can be used in preliminary testing of the therapeutic
eﬃcacy in treating dysbiosis-associated diseases, as they allow
monitoring of the pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic changes
in microbial communities,
thus facilitating optimization of
treatment and dosage regime (Mahe et al., 1987; Silva et al.,
1999).

at its preliminary stage, the ﬁndings are deemed intriguing yet
promising in terms of ﬁlling the knowledge gap in microbiome-
host relationships, and their role in disease pathogenesis, as well
as therapeutic value, which requires more in-depth investigations
to uncover this exciting yet mysterious ﬁeld of research. Below,
we review recent investigations speciﬁcally related to the bacterial
microbiome in the GIT – the largest microbial reservoir of
the human body. Gut microbiota and the microbial-synthesized
metabolites are discussed along with their roles in human
wellness and normal functioning. Further, we review several
studies related to the gut microbiome dysbiosis and its association
with speciﬁc human diseases. We introduce novel microbiome-
based therapy employed in speciﬁc disease conditions to ‘restore’

we discuss future directions and research areas that require
further elucidation in order to better understand the human
microbiome and its relationship with the host.

THE GUT MICROBIOME AND ITS
MULTIFARIOUS FUNCTIONS

interactions

The symbiotic relationship between the gut microbiota and
the host is regulated and stabilized by a complex network
of
immune, and
that encompass metabolic,
neuroendocrine crosstalk between them. This crosstalk is
potentially mediated by microbial-synthesized metabolites
which exhibit pleiotropic eﬀects, including acting as signaling
molecules in regulating host neuro-immune-inﬂammatory axes
that could physiologically link gut with other organ systems.
The predominant functions of gut microbiota and the associated
key metabolites in governing host wellness are depicted in the
following subsections, with some other microbial metabolites
being described in Table 1.

Metabolism
Human fecal
sample analysis using 16S ribosomal RNA
and metagenomic sequencing techniques reveal signiﬁcant
enrichment in metabolism of polysaccharides, amino acids,
xenobiotics and micronutrients conferred by gut microbiota,
suggest that these indigenous microbes facilitate host energy
harvesting and metabolic eﬃciency (Gill et al., 2006). These
ﬁndings were further validated by germ-free (GF) mice
experiments where it was found that germ-free mice had
40% lower epididymal
fat and an additional 10–30% food
consumption was needed to maintain the same body mass as mice
with normal microbiota (Backhed et al., 2004). Gut microbiota is
important in fermenting unabsorbed starch and soluble dietary
ﬁber. The fermented end products exist in the form of a SCFAs.
SCFA (such as butyrate, propionate, acetate and pentanoate) act
as one of the energy substrates for the host (Salminen et al.,
1998) thereby contributing an extra 10% daily dietary energy
for utilization by the host for other metabolic processes (Payne
et al., 2012). Microbial-synthesized SCFAs contribute 70% of
ATP production in colon, with butyrate as the preferred fuel
for colonocytes (Firmansyah et al., 1989; Donohoe et al., 2011).
Butyrate-producing microbes rescued the deﬁcit mitochondrial
respiration, ATP synthesis and autophagy in colonocytes of germ-
free mice (Donohoe et al., 2011), proving the importance of
butyrate in colonic cellular respiration and energy production.
Furthermore, SCFAs which are the ligands for G protein-coupled
receptor 41 (GPR41) expressed by a subset of the gut epithelial
enteroendocrine cells, had been shown to regulate energy
homeostasis by stimulating GPR41-mediated leptin production
in mouse adipocytes, in which this multifunctional circulating
hormone, leptin exhibits pleiotropic eﬀects on a vast range of
host physiological functions such as energy metabolism, appetite,
as well as sympathetic nerve activity and immune response,
potentially giving rise to interactive host-microbe signaling and

gut-brain axis immune-inﬂammatory crosstalk (Xiong et al.,
2004; Samuel et al., 2008).

Besides SCFA, gut microbiota-synthesized micronutrients
such as vitamins exhibit beneﬁcial value for both microbial
and host metabolisms. Vitamin-K-producing gut bacteria
namely Bacteroides fragilis, Eubacterium lentum, Enterobacter
agglomerans, Serratia marcescens, and Enterococcus faecium
(Fernandez and Collins, 1987; Cooke et al., 2006) anaerobically
synthesize vitamin K2 (menaquinone) which is essential
in
decreasing vascular calciﬁcation, elevating HDL and lowering
cholesterol levels, contributing to lower risk of cardiovascular
disorders such as atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease
(Kawashima et al., 1997; Geleijnse et al., 2004). Gut microbiota
also serves as an important source of vitamins B for the host
(Salminen et al., 1998; Degnan et al., 2014). Among them,
vitamins B5 and B12, which are exclusively synthesized by
intestinal microbiota, act as coenzyme for extensive range of host
biochemical processes including production of acetylcholine and
cortisol which are required for normal functioning of the nervous
system. Deﬁciency of vitamins B5 and B12 have been linked to
several disorders such as gastrointestinal discomfort, insomnia,
neuropsychological and hematological disorders (Andres et al.,
2004; Gominak, 2016). However, the possible link between loss of
vitamin-producing gut microbiota and disease onset has not yet
been elucidated.

such as Clostridium perfringens

Gut microbiota also plays an important role in the co-
metabolism of bile acids with the host. These cholesterol
derivatives are synthesized in the liver, followed by conjugation
with taurine or glycine prior to storage in the gall bladder
and subsequent secretion into duodenum to aid digestion,
cholesterol and lipid metabolisms. In humans, 95% of bile
acids are reabsorbed at distal ileum (Staels and Fonseca, 2009).
The 5% unabsorbed primary bile acids are then bioconverted
or deconjugated to secondary bile acids
(predominantly
DCA and LCA) by bile salt hydrolases secreted by several
and
colonic microbiota
Clostridium scindens, followed by partly colonic reabsorption
and transportation back to liver for conjugation (Gopal-
Srivastava and Hylemon, 1988; Ajouz et al., 2014) and the
unabsorbed secondary bile acids are excreted by the host (Sorg
and Sonenshein, 2008). Both primary and secondary bile acids
are able to activate host nuclear FXR signaling, which in turn
regulates the bile acids production, glucose metabolism, and
potentially hepatic autophagy (Lee et al., 2014; Nie et al., 2015).
Secondary bile acids serve as a potent activator of TGR5 (a
member of the Rhodopsin-like subfamily of GPCRs) which is
widely expressed on diﬀerent tissues including in gall bladder,
liver, spleen,
intestine, and the immune cells. Such GPCR
activation will stimulate second messenger c-AMP production,
and the subsequent c-AMP-dependent downstream signaling,
inducing expressions of a multitude of genes, whereby its
physiological importance remains to be fully elucidated, pointing
toward impacts of secondary bile acid-TCR5 axis (Hylemon
et al., 2009). Secondary bile acids also possess antimicrobial
eﬀects which alter microbial cell membrane integrity, causing
spillage of intracellular contents, thus inhibiting growth of bile
acid-intolerant microbes (Nie et al., 2015). Such antimicrobial
