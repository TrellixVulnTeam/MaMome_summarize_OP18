Pregnancy and the Microbiome

that we are born germ free (Tissier, 1900) and is still the belief
of many physicians, numerous pieces of evidence now cast
doubt on this hypothesis, and suggest that a bacterial presence
already exists in the feto-placental unit (Hu et al., Moreover, we suggest that the
changes in the human microbiome are deeply connected to
the host’s physiological status, and that
these associations
have developed throughout co-evolution of microbiome and
host
to ensure improved ﬁtness. Just as weight gain in pregnancy is necessary to
provide the needs of the growing fetus, so are the inﬂammatory
state and insulin insensitivity. With
the emergence of microbiome research and the realization that
changes in the maternal microbiome compositions occur during
pregnancy, it has been suggested that there may be correlations
between the microbial communities present, and the health of the
pregnancy (Mysorekar and Cao, 2014). However,

the gut microbiota of

several additional studies have shown distinct eﬀects of delivery
mode on the gut microbiota composition of newborn babies. More speciﬁcally, elevation of progesterone
may increase gut permeability, which could assist in bacterial
transmission into the bloodstream and subsequently into the
mother’s mammary glands (Jeurink et al.,
