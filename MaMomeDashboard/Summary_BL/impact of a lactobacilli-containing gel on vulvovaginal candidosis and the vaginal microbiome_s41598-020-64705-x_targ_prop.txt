First we explored in detail the in vitro inhibitory effects of a selection of LGC strains against growth and 
pathogenic properties (adhesion to vaginal cells and hyphae formation) of Candida albicans. S1)..

The lactobacilli with the strongest antimicrobial effects showed adhesive capacities of 11.3% (L. plantarum 
WCFS1), 11.8% (L. rhamnosus GG) and 34.7% (L. pentosus KCA1)  to vaginal keratinocyte cell line 
(VK2/E6E7), used as model for the vaginal epithelium. The concentration of viable lactobacilli did decline during storage at 25 °C, 
showing roughly a ten-fold reduction after 6 months of storage..
