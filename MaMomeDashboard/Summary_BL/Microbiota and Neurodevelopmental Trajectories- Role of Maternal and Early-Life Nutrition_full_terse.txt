This 
chapter reviews the natural trajectory of the composition 
of  the  microbiota  during  pregnancy  and  early  life  and 
outlines  the  current  knowledge  on  the  interaction  be-
tween the microbiota and neurodevelopment. Early-Life Neurodevelopmental Plasticity and the 
Microbiota
Dramatic  structural  and  functional  changes  in  the 
brain are characteristic of the first years of life. An  in-
crease in the presence of Lactobacilli helps maintain a low 
pH, limiting bacterial growth opportunity for other bacte-
ria  Furthermore, vaginal microbiota composition is 
critical in the context of vertical transmission of microbial 
populations  Whether interventions in the physiologi-
cal trajectory of maternal microbiota could alter the prena-
tal environment and, in turn, deviate normal brain devel-
opment is a key question in neuroscience that is starting to 
be addressed both in preclinical and clinical areas. Administration of probiot-

infant exposure to differences in diet, drugs and stress can 
interfere with the trajectory of the microbiota and neuro-
development in a manner that is characteristic of this de-
velopmental period. J.F.C., T.G.D. and C.S. are
