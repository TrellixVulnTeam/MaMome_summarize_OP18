Table 1. As  a  case  in  point,  coumestrol,  a
phytoestrogen, from alfalfa (clover) is used in rodent diets, which
increases the ingestion of estrogen equivalents by mice compared
with humans (Degen et al., 2012)] and the interactions with the gut microbiota [e.g. some models
do not develop colitis in germ-free conditions (Hudcovic et al., However, it should be highlighted
that the host-microbe relationships in these humanized models do
not necessarily reflect the real relationships seen in humans, because
the gut microbiota is transplanted into a host with which it has not
co-evolved. This
difference  is  thought  to  be  due  to  the  fact  that  the  rat  has  a
microbiota  that  is  more  similar  to  humans  than  mice  do,  thus
facilitating the establishment of the inoculated microbiota (Wos-
Oxley  et  al., Non-human  primates  are  also  suitable  models  for  human  gut
microbiota  research,  with  the  obvious  advantage  of  close
evolutionary relatedness to humans.
