Several studies have demonstrated modulation of colonic 
microbiota by prebiotic inulin or inulin-type fructans. Clostridium XIVa
E. halli R. hominis
Anaerostipes . Together, these factors accounted for 18.7% of the 
observed inter-individual variation in the gut microbiome 
with diet being a major modulator of gut microbiome vari-
ation . Given the profound effect of PPIs on the gut microbiome 
and the fact that over 11% of population in The Netherlands 
and other European countries are using PPIs on prescription 
(not including over the counter use of PPIs) implies a major 
PPI-dependent influence on the gut microbiome taxonomy 
and function on a populational scale..

The human gut microbiota contains bacteria that are ben-
eficial to the host, and bacteria with pathogenic potential, 
termed ‘pathobionts’  An important role of beneficial 
bacteria is the metabolic production of SCFAs by cross-feed-
ing . The bar represents 10 µm (Photo, M. Sadaghian Sadabad). nitrate, which was generated as a byproduct of the inflamma-
tory host response, selectively enhanced growth of E. coli in 
the large intestine of mice  Moreover, F. prausnitzii pro-
duces a 15 kDa anti-inflammatory protein that inhibits the 
NF-κB pathway in intestinal epithelial cells and was shown 
to prevent colitis in a mouse model .
