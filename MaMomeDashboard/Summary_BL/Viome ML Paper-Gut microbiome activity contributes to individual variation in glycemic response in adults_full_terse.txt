. The actual iAUC values for all meals, the repeated meals from Figure 
2D, and the glucose drink are shown in Figure 3A. 

Figure 3B was constructed after modeling iAUC with standardized 
macronutrient values (i.e., z-scores). Importantly,  the  inclusion  of  random  effects  captures  individual 
variation  in  PPGR  due  to  unobserved  factors  (unknown  properties 
of the individual, meal, or measurement devices) that may affect the
