of intravaginal nonoxyl-9 (an ingredient in spermicide and a commonly used cytotoxic control) and univer-
sal placebo gel (isotonic) found that both have inflammatory effects on cells of the cervix and endometrium12. After six hours of co-culture, both the laboratory strain and a representative clinical strain of E. coli (from a 
postmenopausal woman with cystitis) were similarly impacted by the tested products ..

To test the observed interactions in a more high-fidelity model, the vaginal products with the most significant 
inhibitory effects in simple co-culture were then co-cultured with bacteria in the presence of an immortalized 
vaginal epithelial cell line (VK2, ATCC, VA) grown in keratinocyte serum-free (KSF) media. b) Final change in growth of L. crispatus, as measured in CFU (simple 
co-culture, without vaginal epithelial cells), demonstrating inhibition by Replens Long-Lasting moisturizer 
and Trimo-San (p < 0.01). b) Final change in growth of 
L. crispatus, as measured in CFU (in 1:100 diluted product and MRS/KSF cell culture media as control), 
demonstrating a lack of inhibition by KY Jelly, Replens Long-Lasting moisturizer and Trimo-San, regardless of 
the presence of human vaginal epithelial cells (p > 0.05)..

Our results expand on previous in vitro studies which showed that KY Jelly is bactericidal to L. crispatus and 
L. jensenii15. www.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/Lactobacillus spp.16. While the co-culture experiments that do not include human cells use a 
concentration of products that is more akin to what might be seen in actual use, the more dilute concentrations 
necessary to maintain human cells do inhibit E. coli when human cells are not present. This suggests factors in 
addition to concentration of product may contribute to bacterial survival or growth. Plates were incubated at 37 °C 
with agitation for 6 hours. The plates were incubated anaerobically at 37 °C without agitation 
for 12 hours.
