infant nutrition, and common clinical practices in neonatal
care  We hypothesize that assembly and function
of the preterm infantsâ€™ gut microbiota is associated with
postnatal growth patterns and represents a yet unexplored
personalized therapeutic potential for optimizing infant
development. c Bar charts representing the average weighted UniFrac distance
between consecutive samples of each individual infant. Conclusion
To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate an
association between gut microbiota phase, nutritional in-
take, and growth of preterm infants. Third, in both the phase- and period-based
models, the abundance of several dominant infant gut
microbiota taxa (e.g., Bifidobacterium) were signifi-
cantly affected by gestational age at birth, PMA at sam-
pling, total calories and proportions of macronutrients
consumed at the week of sampling, and multiple clinical
variables. For each functional pathway from the
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) that
was putatively identified, comparisons were made be-
tween the phases using LEfSe, which identifies features
that are statistically differentially abundant among bio-
logical classes (in this case phases) and then performs
comparative tests between pairs of biological classes to
identify where these features are significantly enriched
or diminished. DOCX 14 kb)
