the Prevotella to Bacteroides ratio. Diversity and richness are
also common measures used to highlight differences between
groups . Both animal and in vitro models have limitations when
it comes to drawing conclusions about human health and
nutrition as they lack the specific interactions present in
the human supraorganism. For further information, readers
are directed to additional reviews of animal and
