Gut microbiota are composed of several species of microorganisms, including bacteria, yeast,
and viruses. Lachnospiraceae, Peptostreptococcaceae, and
Clostridiaceae were dominant genera in both preterm and term pigs. abundance in preterm than term pigs was found . The introduction of solid foods and the termination of milk-feeding/weaning coincide with
major gut microbiota changes. With regard to older people over the age of 70, gut microbiota composition can be affected by
digestion and nutrient absorption changes and immune activity weakness. and an increase in Clostridium and Proteobacteria have been observed 
Given the role of Biﬁdobacterium spp. Lachnospiraceae *
Peptostreptococcaceae *
Clostridiaceae *. Each enterotype
with its distinctive clusters of bacteria and respective functional characteristics deﬁnes a distinctive
way of generating energy from fermentable substrates available in the colon. Indeed, bacteria clusters
of enterotype I derive energy primarily from carbohydrates using principally glycolysis and pentose
phosphate pathways, whereas bacteria clusters of enterotypes II and III are able to degrade mucin
glycoproteins of the gut mucosal layer. Enterotypes seem to be principally deﬁned according to dietary
habits. Indeed, patients with CD show a reduction in beneﬁcial
species (Lactobacillus and Biﬁdobacterium) and an increase in those potentially pathogenic (Bacteroides
and E. coli) as compared to healthy subjects  The mucosal layer of CD patients fails to stabilize the
gut microbiota and fails to prevent the host from the invasion of harmful antigens and pathogens 
This dysbiosis is reduced, but may still remain, after a gluten-free diet . and lower proportions of Bacteroides spp. and an increase in various opportunistic pathogens (Clostridium spp.,
