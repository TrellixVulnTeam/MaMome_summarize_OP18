stool microbiota richness (i.e. the number of different genera in the
population) was estimated at 226 bacterial genera across 208 donors,
using the data from the Human Microbiome Project Consortium (Li
et al., Meta-analysis of mouse and human fecal microbiota based on published 16S rDNA sequencing data. ( Enterotypes  were  also  identified  in  the  laboratory  mouse  gut
microbiota  (Hildebrand  et  al., These
mice, which lack the gene encoding the hormone leptin, which has
a crucial role in the regulation of the appetite, have increased food
intake  as  compared  with  wild-type  mice  and  ultimately  become
obese. Using wild-type and leptin-deficient (ob/ob)
mice,  Turnbaugh  and  colleagues  proposed  that  the  obese  gut
microbiome has an increased capacity to harvest energy from the
host diet (Turnbaugh et al., With respect to the role of the gut microbiota, large
inter-individual variations among IBD patients regarding genetic
background, stage of the disease and diet have made it difficult to
identify clear associations between compositional changes in the gut
microbiota  and  the  pathology. This said, some prominent changes in the gut microbiota
have been concomitantly observed in independent IBD studies using
a  variety  of  techniques  on  different  cohorts,  such  as  reduced
bacterial  diversity  in  both  Crohn’s  disease  and  ulcerative  colitis
patients (Andoh et al., In  these  models,  gut  bacterial  diversity  was
found to be reduced, with certain shifts in gut microbiota profiles
in  Enterobacteriaceae
being  observed,  such  as

Fig. A,B) Histology images of colon cross-sections from control (A) and dextran sulfate sodium
(DSS)-treated (B) mice. These
factors  can  be  confounders  but  can  also  be  controlled  for  with
appropriate experimental design in mouse studies. Even with these variations, chow diet is composed mainly of plant
materials  and  thus  differs  considerably  to  the  composition  and
variation in a human daily diet. Murine  models  are  usually  inbred  in  order  to  reduce  the
phenotypic  variation  that  arises  from  genetic  heterogeneity. 2013), it is
crucial to control for all contributing factors to increase statistical
power. 2012)] and the interactions with the gut microbiota [e.g. some models
do not develop colitis in germ-free conditions (Hudcovic et al., These cases highlight
how the use of colitis mouse models in gut microbiota research will
require  controlling  for  additional  variables  beyond  the  common
confounders (such as host genetic background and environmental
factors). The intrinsic complexity of gut microbiota research,
together with the inconsistency of colitis mouse models (chemically
induced or genetically engineered), makes interpreting the results of
gut  microbiota  research  from  these  models  in  terms  of  human
disease far from easy. However, it should be highlighted
that the host-microbe relationships in these humanized models do
not necessarily reflect the real relationships seen in humans, because
the gut microbiota is transplanted into a host with which it has not
co-evolved. However, the complex interactions between the bacteria composing
the gut community (Faust and Raes, 2012) suggest that this might
not be the case. This said, they are one of
very few methods to assess causality in microbiota research, and
thus  further  development  and  improvement  of  this  approach  is
essential. This
difference  is  thought  to  be  due  to  the  fact  that  the  rat  has  a
microbiota  that  is  more  similar  to  humans  than  mice  do,  thus
facilitating the establishment of the inoculated microbiota (Wos-
Oxley  et  al., In
addition, significant differences in abundance were found across 320
out of 376 genera. 2012), which are of industrial relevance. Non-human  primates  are  also  suitable  models  for  human  gut
microbiota  research,  with  the  obvious  advantage  of  close
evolutionary relatedness to humans. Acknowledgements
