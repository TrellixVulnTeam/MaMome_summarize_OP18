However, the aforementioned studies were

vaginal microbiome was examined longitudi-
nally during gestation using the V3V5 amplicon
of 16S rRNA in 12 subjects that were mostly
Caucasian (Walther-Anto´ nio et al. The maternal microbiome during infancy, and
not solely delivery mode, may be an important
factor in establishing the neonatal microbiome. Similarly, if the in-
fant was born by cesarean delivery, the infant
microbiome most closely resembled the skin
microbiome (Dominguez-Bello et al. This is in contrast to
previous studies ﬁnding that Bacteroides relative
abundance differed based on mode of delivery

to show deﬁnitively that hematogenous spread
