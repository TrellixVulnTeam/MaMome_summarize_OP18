A total of 21 samples – three pools for each of the ﬁve
life stage categories (lab-reared larvae, ﬁeld-collected
larvae, ﬁeld-collected nymphs, ﬁeld-collected adult
females, and ﬁeld-collected adult males), and three
pools for female salivary glands and female midguts –
generated 10 896 297 raw reads on one Illumina MiSeq
ﬂow cell. The relative abundance
of non-Rickettsia taxa increased along developmental
stages (i.e. larvae to nymphs to adults) with the excep-
tion of adult females, which displayed the highest rela-
tive abundance of Rickettsia of all ﬁeld-collected life
stages . Wolbachia was the genus with the second highest. Overall, short
sequences could not be unambiguously placed on single
branches, but were rather assigned along a clade, which
lends a certain degree of conﬁdence. Future studies
examining the functional interplay between tick micro-
biomes and pathogens over a larger geographic region
are warranted.
