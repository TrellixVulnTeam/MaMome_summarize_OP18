in  the  exercised  group  belonged  to  phyla 
Tenericutes, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes. Staphylococcus epidermidis
Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron strain 8669. indicated a strong association of 
the intestinal microbiome with the develop­ 
ment of obesity. In line with these 
reports,  it  is  relevant  that  we  detected  an 
increased abundance of several Firmicutes, 
primarily Enterococcaceae (e.g., Enterococcus 
faecium), in the exercised mice. . Nevertheless, E. faecium isolates from 
clinical outbreaks are different strains than 
E. faecium from animals, food, and humans 
in  the  community  (Franz  et  al. Thus, our data are consistent 
because we observed a decrease in the num­ 
ber of Erysipelotrichaceae in exercised mice 
that had lost a substantial amount of body 
weight;  this  is  associated  with  the  role  of 
Erysipelotrichaceae in energy production and 
adiposity (Claus et al.
