and anti-inflammatory responses, and balances in the community structure of gut bacteria
may be intimately linked to the proper function of the immune system. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 July 14. Alternatively, the particular diet given to the animal might influence Treg subsets within the
intestine as most animal food, even if autoclaved, may have varying amounts of microbial
molecules (such as TLR ligands). The importance of B. fragilis in
maintenance of a healthy immune response was recently illustrated by the finding that
colonization by B. fragilis or treatment with purified PSA can protect from the induction of
experimental IBD66. Perhaps genetic and habitual factors shape the composition
of the microbiota, which in turn shapes the immune system of individuals predisposed to
inflammatory disease (Figure 3). Small lymphoid aggregates located in the anti-mesenteric wall of the
small intestine and containing B cells, dendritic cells, stromal cells
and some T cells.
