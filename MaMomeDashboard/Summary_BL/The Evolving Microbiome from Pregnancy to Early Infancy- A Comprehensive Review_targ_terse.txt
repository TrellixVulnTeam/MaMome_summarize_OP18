Abstract: Pregnancy induces a number of immunological, hormonal, and metabolic changes that are
necessary for the mother to adapt her body to this new physiological situation. argued the weakness of evidence supporting the. Normal changes in
the vaginal ﬂora during pregnancy are transitions to another Lactobacillus community, and this stability
would protect against ascending infections through the genital tract. However, it is unclear where the fetal microbiota comes from, and when is the ﬁrst fetal exposition. Diﬀerent studies have also detected microbiome in the ﬁrst baby fecal sample, the meconium,
supporting the in utero exposure to bacteria  Staphylococcus has been reported as the most
prevalent bacteria in meconium samples, followed by Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus, Lactobacillus,
and Biﬁdobacterium even in infants born by C-section  Modiﬁcation in placental microbiota may
be related with adverse pregnancy outcomes of pregnancy or symptoms of clinical infection . Importantly, C-section may decrease the colonization of milk-digested bacteria including the
genus Lactobacillus in newborns during the ﬁrst months of life  In addition, the mode of delivery
has a relevant impact on the microbiota composition of colostrums and milk  which also may
be inﬂuenced by antibiotics administrated during C-section.
