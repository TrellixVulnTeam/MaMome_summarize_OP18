This 
chapter reviews the natural trajectory of the composition 
of  the  microbiota  during  pregnancy  and  early  life  and 
outlines  the  current  knowledge  on  the  interaction  be-
tween the microbiota and neurodevelopment. Early-Life Neurodevelopmental Plasticity and the 
Microbiota
Dramatic  structural  and  functional  changes  in  the 
brain are characteristic of the first years of life. Devia-
tions  from  the  neurodevelopmental  trajectory  can  ac-
count for increased susceptibility to brain diseases later 
in life. There is a growing appreciation of the link between 
neurodevelopment and intestinal microbiota. The vaginal microbiota composition also changes dur-
ing pregnancy towards a less diverse configuration  
As with gastrointestinal microbiota, the change in vaginal 
microbiota  has  a  specific  role  during  pregnancy. An  in-
crease in the presence of Lactobacilli helps maintain a low 
pH, limiting bacterial growth opportunity for other bacte-
ria  Furthermore, vaginal microbiota composition is 
critical in the context of vertical transmission of microbial 
populations  Whether interventions in the physiologi-
cal trajectory of maternal microbiota could alter the prena-
tal environment and, in turn, deviate normal brain devel-
opment is a key question in neuroscience that is starting to 
be addressed both in preclinical and clinical areas. Deficiency in B vi-
tamins, folate or ions, such as iron and zinc, exerts detri-
mental effects on neurocognitive development in humans 
and rodents  Folate deficiency is paradigmatic of 
the impact of micronutrient deficit on offspring neurode-
velopment. Administration of probiot-

of non-antibiotic human-targeted drugs have antimicro-
bial  properties. The  sterility  of  the  uterus  during 
pregnancy is one of the paradigms that research on the 
microbiome is revisiting. Bacteria have been found in the 
placenta    amniotic  fluid  and  meconium  of  hu-
mans  Moreover, the presence of specific bacteria 
in utero has been associated with pregnancy risks, includ-
ing  higher  rates  of  preterm  delivery    Nevertheless, 
the reliability of these findings is widely debated in the 
context of whether it is contamination or not  The 
existence of germ-free mice models further dismisses the 
idea of a prenatal microbiome  It is generally accept-
ed that the moment of birth is the first opportunity for 
large-scale bacterial colonization of the newborn. Thus, 
the mode of delivery has a tremendous impact on the es-
tablishment of the microbiota of infants. As with the maternal microbiome, 
infant exposure to differences in diet, drugs and stress can 
interfere with the trajectory of the microbiota and neuro-
development in a manner that is characteristic of this de-
velopmental period. Factors that determine the trajectory 
of the microbiota during early life. The gut 
and  vaginal  microbiome  of  the  mother  is 
altered by diet, drugs and stress. Early  in  life,  diet, 
drugs and stress can also affect the infant 
microbiota composition. Although  plasticity  represents  an  opportunity  for 
adaptation, it is also a vulnerable stage. However, the evidence is still scarce, and 
further research is needed to understand the functional 
implications of these interactions. Further research is needed on the characterization of crit-
ical windows to modulate the microbiota and the conse-
quences of early intervention. Disclosure Statement
