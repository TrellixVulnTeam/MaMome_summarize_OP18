Female infants are generally born smaller than male infants; however, in response to maternal asthma, the
Caucasian male fetus is more likely to have a lower birthweight and show growth retardation when
delivered at term than the female fetus recently reported less colonisation of stool
with Lactobacillus species at birth and during the first month of life among full-term male infants in
comparison to female infants. Data are presented as n (%),unless otherwise stated. Other sex-specific differences
were uncovered. Comparisons were performed
using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. The false discovery rate (FDR) was used to adjust p-values for multiple
testing and crude p-values <FDR p-values are indicated by “#”. The p-values <0.1 are reported and
p-values <0.05 are indicated in bold. ¶: Regression models to
predict
tertile Lactobacillus abundance in infants as the outcome, showed no statistical
associations with prenatal asthma status (data not shown). Only 2% of Caucasian infants received
probiotic products; their exclusion from analyses did not change any of the findings..

Finally, using the LEfSe method to test differences at
Lactobacillus species was found to be less abundant in male Caucasian infants born to mothers with atopic
asthma (LDA score 2.93, p<0.05).
