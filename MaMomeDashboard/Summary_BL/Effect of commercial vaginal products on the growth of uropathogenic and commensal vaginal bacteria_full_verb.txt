of intravaginal nonoxyl-9 (an ingredient in spermicide and a commonly used cytotoxic control) and univer-
sal placebo gel (isotonic) found that both have inflammatory effects on cells of the cervix and endometrium12. Additionally, individual ingredients commonly used in vaginal products have been found to alter the electrical 
resistance and morphology of ectocervical tissue13, and hyperosmolar lubricants have been demonstrated to be 
cytotoxic to vaginal epithelial cells, some of them also altering inflammatory mediators14. To test the observed interactions in a more high-fidelity model, the vaginal products with the most significant 
inhibitory effects in simple co-culture were then co-cultured with bacteria in the presence of an immortalized 
vaginal epithelial cell line (VK2, ATCC, VA) grown in keratinocyte serum-free (KSF) media. When exposed to a 
1:100 dilution of KY Jelly, Replens Long-Lasting moisturizer, or Trimo-San in KSF, the laboratory strain of E. coli 
was inhibited compared to a KSF media control (p = 0.01, Fig. Change in bacterial growth with exposure to vaginal products. ( no VK2 cells

only does adherence potentially permit bacterial proliferation over that seen in liquid media, bacterial microcol-
onization of epithelial cell surfaces may also allow bacteria to access additional food sources. While it is reassuring that these products have a uniformly negative effect on uropath-
ogenic E. coli in vitro, the abrogation of this effect in the presence of human vaginal epithelial cells suggests that 
the interaction may not be that simple. This suggests factors in 
addition to concentration of product may contribute to bacterial survival or growth. In addition, the negative 
impact of some vaginal products on Lactobacillus spp. Our study is limited by the lack of a better human vaginal model. The addition of vaginal epithelial cells brings the co-culture model closer to a human vaginal 
model and the differing results for E. coli demonstrate the potential drastic difference between in vitro and in vivo 
studies. Materials and Methods
Bacterial culture preparation. The following lubricants were used undiluted: KY Jelly, Replens Silky 
Smooth lubricant, generic coconut oil. Plates were incubated at 37 °C 
with agitation for 6 hours. The plates were incubated anaerobically at 37 °C without agitation 
for 12 hours. However, for lactobacilli, OD 
results were very different from CFU results due to significant clumping of bacteria in the presence of lubricants, 
thus only CFU were used. All 
ingredients were plated on agar to confirm viability of the broth pre-cultures and sterility of test materials. Vaginal epithelial cell co-culture with vaginal product and bacteria. Bacterial broths 
were prepared as described previously, and then centrifuged at 1000 RPM for 5 minutes. Cell death was assessed with a lactate dehydro-
genase cytotoxicity assay (Fisher Scientific, MA). Then 50 µL of KY Jelly, Replens Long-Lasting moisturizer, or Trimo-San were added, 
diluted 1:100 with KSF cell culture medium. was inhibited in the KSF media alone, a 1:1 mixture of MRS/KSF medium was utilized for that portion of the 
experiment, which was found to have a minimal impact on human cell viability (Supplemental Fig. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.
