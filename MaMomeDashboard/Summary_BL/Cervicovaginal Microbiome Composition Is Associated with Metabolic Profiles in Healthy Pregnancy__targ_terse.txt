The human vaginal microbiome maintains low diversity in low-pH conditions and
depends on host sugars as carbon sources, with less access to dietary and exogenous
nutrients than the gut, skin, or oral cavity. This association between the most abundant bacterial taxa and
microbial composition of the sample was signiﬁcant and explained more than half
of the variance using permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA)
(R2 (cid:2) 56%; P (cid:2) 0.0001). While some
individuals exhibited a relatively stable microbial community over time, others 
experienced shifts in composition, resulting in a statistically signiﬁcant change in
Bray-Curtis dissimilarity on PC axis 1 between trimesters ..

absence of fungi, at the genus level, per sample. LEfSe identiﬁed several pathways that differed between
L. crispatus and G. vaginalis, in particular, an enrichment of ammonia assimilation genes
in G. vaginalis . The resolution provided by shotgun metag-
enomic sequencing allowed us to identify species and characterize the functional gene
content of CVF microbiomes. Further, metabolomic analysis of
our CVF samples failed to capture signiﬁcant levels of the mannitol precursor fructose;
however, previous studies have indicated an appreciable amount of fructose within the
cervical mucus of humans and the capability of L. crispatus to utilize fructose as a
carbon source  We speculate that this high extracellular mannitol abundance
phenotype may underlie the cell’s need to regenerate NAD(cid:5) for use in glycolysis.
