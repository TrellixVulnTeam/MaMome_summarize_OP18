Vieira et al. However, in the presence
of stressors that can perturb this homeostasis, several oral
infectious diseases may appear,
including dental caries and
periodontitis (Almstahl et al., 2007), such as cardiovascular diseases (Joshipura et al., Moreover, the
vaginal and buccal epithelia share some microscopic similarities. According to
the literature (Meurman et al., 2009), together with climacteric
complaints, various oral discomforts are reported in menopausal
women. Few studies
have investigated the eﬀects of hormone replacement therapy in
such patients (Mahesh et al., 2016), although the
corresponding study did not focus on the evaluation of such
diﬀerences between menopausal and non-menopausal women. Periodontal disease, which includes
gingivitis and periodontitis, is highly prevalent in adults, and
disease severity increases with age. Fluctuating female sexual hormone levels in menopausal
women may represent key factors that respond to changes
detected in the oral cavity (Dutt et al., Menopause
is accompanied by decreased bone density, which may have

Vieira et al. Among other
host factors, the oral microbiota serves as an inoculum for the
intestine, and the microorganisms that ﬁnd adequate conditions
in the mouth give rise to distinct types of communities in
the intestine. THE INTERACTION BETWEEN GUT
MICROBIOTA AND FEMALE SEX
HORMONES

As mentioned earlier, female sex hormones levels inﬂuence
the composition of the microbiota in many sites of the body,
especially the gut. Due to intimate contact with the larger gut
immune system, the gut microbiota has been shown to inﬂuence
many diseases outside of this organ (Figure 1). Interestingly, germ-free NOD female mice lack this gender bias
for diabetes. In general, this study shows that the microbiome
is a causal factor and not simply a consequence of autoimmune
disease. Microbiota and Female Sex Hormones

levels or the absence of estrogen hormone in the metabolism of
women have not been suﬃciently studied and require further
clariﬁcation. Another link between the gut microbiome and menopausal
health is related to bone. Experimental studies have also demonstrated
similar results. Additionally, sex
steroid deprivation has been reported to promote intestinal
permeability (Figure 1), and the oral administration of
L. rhamnosus GG (LGG) or VSL#3 (a combination of tree
probiotics) to estrogen-deﬁcient mice signiﬁcantly reinforced
intestinal barrier integrity and completely protected the mice
against sex steroid depletion-induced bone loss (Li et al., Importantly, to conﬁrm the role of the gut microbiota in bone
health, another experiment also showed that germ-free mice are
protected against the bone loss induced by the absence of sex
steroids (Li et al., In this scenario,
