Presence of haustrum and taenia coli in the colon . Gross anatomy of the human and the mouse gastrointestinal
tract. ( In mice, these
cells  are  abundant  along  the  surface  of  intestinal  crypts  in  the
proximal colon but, in the distal colon and rectum, their number
decreases at the base of the crypt. Conversely, in humans, goblet
cells are abundant from cecum to rectum. 2009)..

Recently, a study by Krych et al. 2012), Riboulet-Bisson (Riboulet-Bisson et. 2013),  being  dominated  by
Lachnospiraceae  and  Ruminococcaceae  or  Bacteroidaceae  and
Enterobacteriaceae, respectively. Some common trends
have emerged from this research. This said, some prominent changes in the gut microbiota
have been concomitantly observed in independent IBD studies using
a  variety  of  techniques  on  different  cohorts,  such  as  reduced
bacterial  diversity  in  both  Crohnâ€™s  disease  and  ulcerative  colitis
patients (Andoh et al., 2011),  a  reduction  in  the  levels  of  the  anti-
inflammatory  bacterium  Faecalibacterium (Andoh  et  al., 2009), and an increase in abundance of Enterobacteriaceae (such as
E. coli) (Duboc et al., Despite this, the major gut microbiota shifts that have been observed
in  different  colitis  mouse  models  are  similar  to  those  found  in
human  IBD  studies. 2011)  and  human
(Fernandez-Raudales et al., 2001)].
The  concern  is  not  only  that  symptoms  are  not  concordant  with
human IBD, but that the underlying mechanism, such as the cross-talk
between the immune system and the gut microbiota, might not be the
same in the mouse model being used..

al., This
difference  is  thought  to  be  due  to  the  fact  that  the  rat  has  a
microbiota  that  is  more  similar  to  humans  than  mice  do,  thus
facilitating the establishment of the inoculated microbiota (Wos-
