significant differences in abundance between 
comparison groups. The  Welch’s  test  revealed 
that  exposure  to  the  PCB  mixture  signifi­
cantly (p < 0.05 by Student’s t­test) altered 
the abundance of 1,223 bacterial taxa in these 
mice (1,133 taxa had decreased abundance 
and 90 taxa had increased abundance). Exposure  to  the  PCB  mixture  did  not 
alter bio diversity of the gut microbiome; all 
11,229 taxa were detected in at least one sam­
ple from sedentary mice. Although the data we reported here are 
novel, effects of physical activity on several

however, they are likely to be mediated by 
altering the host factors that influence the 
intestinal micro environment.
