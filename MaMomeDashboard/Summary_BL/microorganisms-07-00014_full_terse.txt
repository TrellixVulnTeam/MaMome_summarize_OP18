The majority of these techniques are based on the extraction of DNA and the ampliﬁcation of the 16S
ribosomal RNA gene (rRNA)  16S rRNA sequencing has become the most useful technique to
highlight diversity and abundance of the microbiome. Moreover, recent studies have identiﬁed a
critical role for commensal bacteria and their products in regulating the development, homeostasis,
and function of innate and adaptive immune cells  It is paradoxical to note that the gut microbiota
functions are highly preserved between individuals, whereas each individual’s gut microbiota are
characterized by a speciﬁc combination of bacterial species due to inter-individual and intra-individual
variations throughout human life. The abundance of genera Biﬁdobacterium, Clostridium coccoides, and
Bacteroides are predominant after weaning  The microbiota of breastfed children and the microbiota
of children previously fed with formula milk become closer to each other (Table 1). Dietary habit changes
(more monotonous) may also weaken gut microbiota diversity. Microbiota variations within individuals. Moreover, none of the differences in alpha
diversity has been observed between PD cases and controls, whereas beta diversity has been
revealed for three bacterial families (Lactobacillaceae, Barnesiellaceae, and Enterococcaceae)  PD is
associated with changes in gut microbiota and this gut microbiota dysbiosis may be the mechanism of
neuroinﬂammation that leads to PD pathology 

Hepatic Encephalopathy

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a complication of cirrhosis and is deﬁned as a spectrum
of neuropsychiatric abnormalities in patients with liver dysfunctions.
