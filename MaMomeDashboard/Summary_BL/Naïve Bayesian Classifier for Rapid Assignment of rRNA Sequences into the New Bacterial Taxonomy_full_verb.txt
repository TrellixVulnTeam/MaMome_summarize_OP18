Number of taxa at different ranks

Taxonomy

No. The taxa (and hence the tests) are nested, and no
attempt is made to correct for multiple tests. The RDP SeqMatch tool is a k-nearest-neighbor
(k-NN) classiﬁer  It uses a word-matching strategy not requiring alignment to
determine the percentage of shared seven-character words between a query and
members of a database of sequences. Aligned 16S rRNA sequences were selected at the RDP
website and analyzed using the RDP Tree Builder tool. Tree Builder incorporates branch-order conﬁdence estimation using 100 boot-
strap samples. A user can submit one sequence or a group of sequences for classiﬁ-
cation. Users can navigate through
the hierarchy by clicking on the various taxa. Clicking on the “show assignment
detail” link will display the detailed classiﬁcation results for all or a speciﬁed
subset of the user’s queries. Results can be downloaded in a text format
and imported into a spreadsheet program for further analysis. These sequences formed the Bergey corpus. These
sequences are classiﬁed into 1,187 genera in the NCBI taxonomy  Initial
placement into the NCBI taxonomy is based on information provided by the
sequence submitter, with modiﬁcations by the NCBI staff. The sequences aver-
aged 1,454 bases in length. Classiﬁer accuracy versus bootstrap conﬁdence

a Bootstrap conﬁdence reﬂects the frequency of most common assignments
out of 100 bootstrap samplings. For each of the 393 near-full-length sequences misclassiﬁed
at the genus level, we determined the distance to other mem-
bers of the Bergey corpus by calculating the pairwise identity
between sequences using the corresponding aligned sequences
from the RDP website. performed based on the default conﬁdence threshold of 80%. Taxa with signiﬁcant differences in representation are
marked. The comparison results can also be displayed in a table sorted by
signiﬁcance. The process was
repeated for all sequences in the corpus. For these se-
quences, the (obviously) incorrect genus assignment was not
considered in the summary statistics, but the results were in-
cluded for higher ranks containing other genera with valid
training sets . (B) Average bootstrap conﬁdence estimate for each segment. For many such users, a complete and thorough
phylogenetic analysis may not be an option. For shorter sequences, classiﬁcation conﬁdence was greatly
improved by using the bootstrap to estimate classiﬁcation re-
liability (Table 2). SeqMatch misclassiﬁed only
A. acidoterrestris. These regions likely account for
both the increased accuracy for and the broadened peaks
around these variable regions. The online
version of the Classiﬁer returns results for submissions of up to
10,000 user sequences in a few minutes and provides both
summary and detailed classiﬁcation assignments.
