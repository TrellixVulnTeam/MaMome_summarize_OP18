total resveratrol administered was recovered in the form of
resveratrol, dihydroresveratrol and derived metabolites (65.1%
along the gastrointestinal tract, and 0.5% in other tissues).17 So,
it may be very diﬃcult to reach eﬀective concentrations in
metabolism regulating tissues in vivo, e.g. visceral adipose
tissues. 2014, 5, 1241–1249

eﬀects. Discussion

Although obesity arises from interactions of genetic and envi-
ronmental factors,26 a high-fat diet plays an important role in
the induction of visceral obesity in animal models.27 Most sets
of existing evidence on resveratrol suggest that this compound
has anti-obesity eﬀects.11,12,19 But the exact mechanisms of how
resveratrol shows anti-obesity eﬀects are not clear.
