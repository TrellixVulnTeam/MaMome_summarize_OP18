Gut Microbiome in Human Health

INTRODUCTION

The human microbiome comprises of collective genomes of
microbiota inhabiting us, namely protozoa, archaea, eukaryotes,
viruses and predominantly bacteria that live symbiotically on and
within various sites of the human body. These extra genes have
added various types of enzymatic proteins which were non-
encoded by the host, and play a critical role in facilitating
host metabolism, thus contributing to the regulation of host
physiology (Hooper and Gordon, 2001). Until recent decades, the
properties of the human microbiome and the host–microbiota
interactions have been largely unknown due to technology
limitations especially in examining non-cultivable microbes
of interest, and lack of population-scale data depicting the
microbiota compositions and functions. Gut microbiota
also serves as an important source of vitamins B for the host
(Salminen et al., 2014) and the
unabsorbed secondary bile acids are excreted by the host (Sorg
and Sonenshein, 2008). Secondary bile acids serve as a potent activator of TGR5 (a
member of the Rhodopsin-like subfamily of GPCRs) which is
widely expressed on diﬀerent tissues including in gall bladder,
liver, spleen,
intestine, and the immune cells.
