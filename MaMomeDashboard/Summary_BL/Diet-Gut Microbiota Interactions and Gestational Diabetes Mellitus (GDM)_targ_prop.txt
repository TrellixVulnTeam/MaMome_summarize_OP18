Moreover, inverse relationships between Blautia and insulin

gut microbiota might contribute to gestational metabolic changes through different mechanisms,
although further studies on this topic are necessary..

ratio and a reduced abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria such as Roseburia and Faecalibacterium
prausnitzii . A few studies described a different microbiota within 3–16 months after delivery in women with
a previous GDM (GDM+) compared to those with a previous normoglycemic pregnancy (GDM−). Adherents showed a signiﬁcant
decrease in Bacteroides  which is a genus that has been associated with high-fat animal-based
diets  Moreover, at enrolment, total fat intake was associated with higher abundance of Alistipes
and protein intake with Faecalibacterium genus, while, at the end of the pregnancy, ﬁber intake was
associated with the genus Roseburia  However, none of these bacteria were associated with the
changes in metabolic variables occurring during pregnancy in patients with GDM . The intakes of different MACs were associated with different microbe growth: prebiotic ﬁbers,
such as fructans, polydextrose, fructooligosaccharides (FOS), and galactooligosaccharides (GOS) were
linked to the growth of intestinal Biﬁdobacteri and Lactobacilli  resistant starch was reported to
increase the abundance of Ruminococcus, E. rectale, and Roseburia  In animal studies, low-MAC
diets resulted in over-grazing the mucus layer by the gut microbiota, potentially compromising the.
