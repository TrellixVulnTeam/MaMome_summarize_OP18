FIGURE 1. Interestingly, although all patients were 
in clinical remission at study entry, a lower baseline abundance 
of F. prausnitzii (P = 0.014) and Bacteroides (P = 0.030) pre-
dicted relapse after therapy cessation in addition to biochem-
ical markers such as an elevated serum C-reactive protein. This  difference  was  noted  primarily  at  the 
species  level. Response to Biologic and Nonbiologic Therapies
Several  studies  have  examined  the  utility  of  microbial 
markers in predicting relapse in patients with CD or UC.39-41 An 
initial analysis of the longitudinal changes in the microbiome 
was conducted by Kolho et al,41 who profiled 68 children with 
IBD  among  whom  32  received  anti-TNF  therapy. A  second  important  challenge  with  existing  data  is  the  wide  vari-
 
ability in the definition of outcomes. Further, studies 
have  varied  in  the  use  of  symptom-based  disease  activity  scores, 
calprotectin normalization (using different thresholds), endoscopic 
remission, or global physical impression to define the outcome.
