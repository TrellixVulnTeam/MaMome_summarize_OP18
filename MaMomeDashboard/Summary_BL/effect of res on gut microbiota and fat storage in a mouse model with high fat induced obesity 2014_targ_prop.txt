The EUB338 probe
used to determine total counts was labeled with uorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC), while the group- or genus-specic probes
were labeled at the 50-end with indocyanine (Cy3; Sangon

FISH analysis, as a quantitative molecular-based technique, was
applied to assess the microbiota composition. C) Colonic bacterial content of the Lactobacillus
