the  intestinal  microbiota  in  human  health  (Table  1)  it  is  not
surprising  that  it  is  also  involved  in  gastrointestinal  as  well  as  non-
gastrointestinal  diseases,  such  as  obesity/metabolic  syndrome,  and
atherosclerosis/cardiovascular  as  well  as  neurologic/psychiatric
diseases,  making  it  one  of  the  most  dynamic  current  topics  in
biomedical  research  (Table  2). In  the  following,  a  few  examples  will
be  discussed  in  more  detail.
