The microbiological diagnosis of a ‘normal’ or dis-
turbed vaginal microbiota has historically been based on
the Nugent score, the current gold standard diagnostic
method that relies on Gram stain of vaginal smears 
The ‘normal’ vaginal microbiota in non-pregnant repro-
ductive aged women is understood to be dominated by
Lactobacillus species, while an abnormal microbiota
(defined as bacterial vaginosis) is characterized by low
abundance of lactobacilli and an overgrowth of anaer-
obic bacteria, such as Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella
spp., Microbiota profiles
Microbiota profiles were created by PCR amplification
and pyrosequencing of the cpn60 universal target region. were associated with both term and pre-
term. It is important to note that
read depth distribution did not differ between term and
preterm cohorts (t test, p > 0.05); therefore, the differ-
ences observed here in bacteria prevalence were unlikely
to be driven by cohort sequencing bias..

Mollicutes (Mycoplasma and/or Ureaplasma) were de-
tected by family-specific conventional PCR in 28/46
of pregnant women who delivered preterm
(Table 1). Since these
bacteria are detected at very low abundance within the
microbiota profiles, their biological significance in the
vaginal microbiome is questionable. Differences in the
prevalence of several other taxa between groups were
also observed. Similar to our results,
they found an association between increased microbiota
diversity and preterm delivery among women of white
ethnicity (n = 40) (data from women of others ethnicities
was not included in the analysis because of small sample
sizes).
