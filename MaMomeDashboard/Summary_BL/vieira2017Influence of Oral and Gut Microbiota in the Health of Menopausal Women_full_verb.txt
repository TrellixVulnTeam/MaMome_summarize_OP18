postmenopause (after menopause). 2007), such as cardiovascular diseases (Joshipura et al., Moreover, the
vaginal and buccal epithelia share some microscopic similarities. According to
the literature (Meurman et al., Few studies
have investigated the eﬀects of hormone replacement therapy in
such patients (Mahesh et al., The quantitative and qualitative changes in saliva may alter
the regular homeostasis of oral health, subsequently leading to
speciﬁc changes in the salivary bacterial composition (Nasidze
et al., 2016), although the
corresponding study did not focus on the evaluation of such
diﬀerences between menopausal and non-menopausal women. Periodontal Support
The periodontium is the specialized tissue that both surrounds
and supports the teeth. Periodontal disease, which includes
gingivitis and periodontitis, is highly prevalent in adults, and
disease severity increases with age. Fluctuating female sexual hormone levels in menopausal
women may represent key factors that respond to changes
detected in the oral cavity (Dutt et al., Menopause
is accompanied by decreased bone density, which may have

Vieira et al. According to the literature, sex-related
hormonal changes may cause the gums to become more
susceptible to plaque and create a much higher risk for gingivitis
and advanced periodontitis (Suresh and Radfar, 2004). In a cohort study that included 106 women aged 50–58 years,
hormone replacement therapy led to a decreased number of
positive samples showing the periodontal pathogens P. gingivalis,
Prevotella intermedia, and T.
forsythia from the subgingival
plaque (Tarkkila et al., Despite diﬀerences in the composition
of the gut and oral microbiota, the community types observed
in the gut are predictive of the community observed in the
mouth and vice versa (Ding and Schloss, 2014). Interestingly, germ-free NOD female mice lack this gender bias

levels or the absence of estrogen hormone in the metabolism of
women have not been suﬃciently studied and require further
clariﬁcation. Approximately
one in two women over age 50 will break a bone because of
osteoporosis. Experimental studies have also demonstrated
similar results. Importantly, to conﬁrm the role of the gut microbiota in bone
health, another experiment also showed that germ-free mice are
protected against the bone loss induced by the absence of sex
steroids (Li et al., However, only approximately
30–50% of the population can metabolize daidzein (Frankenfeld
et al., In this scenario,

microbiota in many sites of the body, especially mouth and gut. 2014), and the relationship between
the gut microbiota and a lack of estrogen is likely responsible for
weight gain and lipid deposition during menopause (Figure 1). This suppression of Clostridiaceae, a family of Clostridia
associated with obesity (Figure 1),
likely explains why diets
containing phytoestrogens have been shown to improve weight
gain in menopausal women. Few studies have investigated whether prebiotics and
probiotics can improve insulin sensitivity in postmenopausal
women or body fat in mice. Thus,
