Pregnancy
Pregnancy is a unique period in human life, and both 
the gut and vaginal microbiome have evolved to follow an 
optimum trajectory to support the mother and the devel-
oping fetus and allow for the ideal handover of microbi-
ome at birth, informing maternal and child health out-
comes. . Preclinical Models of Early-Life Microbiota Trajectory
Similar to humans, mice and rat intestinal and vaginal 
microbiota  go  through  compositional  changes  during 
pregnancy,  providing  a  robust  preclinical  model  for 
studying the link between maternal gut environment and 
offspring brain development  Early gestation is 
characterized  by  a  transitional  increase  in  the  relative 
abundance of Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium, which 
in late pregnancy decrease to levels seen in non-pregnant 
mice. In contrast, Bacteroides remain relatively elevated 
throughout  pregnancy    Interestingly,  microbiota . In preclinical studies, oligosac-
charides have been shown to modulate the gut-brain axis, 
highlighting  the  role  of  breastfeeding  in  neurodevelop-
ment.
