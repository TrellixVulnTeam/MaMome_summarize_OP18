Eetemadi et al. Given these advances, the integration
of diet, gut microbiome, and human health (DGMH) data has
the potential to drive a paradigm shift in the way wellness states
are measured, diseases are treated, products are designed, and
health interventions are administered. In this article, we summarize the research that has been
done related to DGMH, with a focus on DGMH data and
computational methods. 2019)]. Several studies have demonstrated that the
human intestinal microbiota is seeded before birth (Stinson et al., However, further research is required to establish
direct links between these conditions and the composition of
microbial communities in the gut. In practice, taste and ﬂavor of dietary products is very important to help users commit to any given diet, therefore
sensory analysis should inform all dietary engineering efforts. 2016) or coarse grain information such

(Knight et al., Datasets in which items are characterized by
a high number of features while the number of items is limited
are called high dimensional. Dimensionality can be reduced by grouping OTUs
into phylogenetic variables, regularization, or unsupervised
dimensionality reduction (DR) (explained below). Missing quantities:
Metagenomic data often lacks information about the
functions of the microbial communities which can only be
estimated using meta-transcriptomics or meta-proteomics. Example: Beta-diversity can be used to calculate the similarity between groups of microbiome
samples. Non-parametric tests are
good alternatives when the assumptions regarding the data
being normally distributed do not hold. The goal is to quantify how much this grouping can explain
the distribution of values in any given sample feature (response
variable). Phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs) such as
phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) are used to control
for dependence among observations given the phylogenetic
hierarchies (Washburne et al., CCA ﬁnds linear transformation pairs that are
maximally correlated when applied to data while ensuring
orthogonality for diﬀerent transformation pairs. In a diﬀerent
study, the classiﬁcation task was to identify healthy vs. unhealthy
donors given relative OTU abundance data (including species
level) coming from shotgun metagenomics sequencing of the gut

predictions. In one study, PCA was applied to
predicted abundances of about 10 million genes from the gut

algorithms often require the number of clusters to be provided as
input. When unknown, the number that provides higher cluster
scoring is picked. Microbiome-aware diet recommendations
can be generated from knowledge-based, content-based, or
collaborative ﬁltering, as described next. Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org

Eetemadi et al. The
second challenge is the metabolic characterization of the media
inside the intestine on which gut microbes grow. Then a regression model is trained to
predict post-meal glucose level based on the meal’s nutritional
proﬁle, the individual’s microbiome features, and other personal
information. Several challenges arise when building content-based RSs. As the number
of items increases, the chance of having user scores for the same
item combinations decreases, hence items and users become
equally dissimilar (also relevant to the “high dimensionality”
challenges in Table 3). Applicability of each method depends
on research objectives and data availability.
