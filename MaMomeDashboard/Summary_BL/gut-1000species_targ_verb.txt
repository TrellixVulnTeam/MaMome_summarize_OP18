dramatically expand our knowledge about the functional
contribution of this group to the ecosystem and the host..

The ﬁrst representative of the Bacilli class retrieved from
the gastrointestinal tract was a member of Lactobacillales
order and was isolated in 1900 — Bacillus acidophilus

able to grow on amino acids and can use sulfur directly
from sulfate (McDonald & Johnson, 1975), but their func-
tion in the gastrointestinal tract has not been exploited..

studies (Wilson & Blitchington, 1996; De Filippo et al., According to the current convention, all
Blastocystis isolated from humans are identiﬁed as Blasto-

analysis showed that nine different phylotypes of these
organisms can be detected in the human gastrointestinal

Members of the phyla Micosporidia, Parabasalia and
Metamonada are micro-eukaryotic organisms that contain
ﬂagella and are often commonly termed as ﬂagellates.
