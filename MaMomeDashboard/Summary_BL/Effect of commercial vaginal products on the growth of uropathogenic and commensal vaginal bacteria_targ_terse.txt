of intravaginal nonoxyl-9 (an ingredient in spermicide and a commonly used cytotoxic control) and univer-
sal placebo gel (isotonic) found that both have inflammatory effects on cells of the cervix and endometrium12. b) Final change in growth of L. crispatus, as measured in CFU (simple 
co-culture, without vaginal epithelial cells), demonstrating inhibition by Replens Long-Lasting moisturizer 
and Trimo-San (p < 0.01). b) Final change in growth of 
L. crispatus, as measured in CFU (in 1:100 diluted product and MRS/KSF cell culture media as control), 
demonstrating a lack of inhibition by KY Jelly, Replens Long-Lasting moisturizer and Trimo-San, regardless of 
the presence of human vaginal epithelial cells (p > 0.05)..

Our results expand on previous in vitro studies which showed that KY Jelly is bactericidal to L. crispatus and 
L. jensenii15. www.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/Lactobacillus spp.16. Both formulations of 
Replens, and all products except coconut oil inhibited E. coli, suggesting that L. crispatus may be less susceptible 
than E. coli to antimicrobial effects of these products..

When we added cultured, immortalized vaginal epithelial cells to the model, we demonstrated less inhibition 
of E. coli by the products that had been most inhibitory in the co-culture without vaginal cells. Plates were incubated at 37 Â°C 
with agitation for 6 hours.
