Gut microbiota are composed of several species of microorganisms, including bacteria, yeast,
and viruses. Dietary habit changes
(more monotonous) may also weaken gut microbiota diversity. In particular, 16S
rDNA sequences belonging to the family Lachnospiraceae within the phylum Firmicutes are in greater
abundance in the IBS clone library . Indeed, patients with CD show a reduction in beneﬁcial
species (Lactobacillus and Biﬁdobacterium) and an increase in those potentially pathogenic (Bacteroides
and E. coli) as compared to healthy subjects  The mucosal layer of CD patients fails to stabilize the
gut microbiota and fails to prevent the host from the invasion of harmful antigens and pathogens 
This dysbiosis is reduced, but may still remain, after a gluten-free diet . Colorectal cancer is the third most common cause of cancer mortality in the world 
Structural fecal bacterial segregations between CRC patients and healthy volunteers have been
demonstrated  The gut microbiota of the CRC patients were enriched in Bacteroides fragilis,
Enterococcus, Escherichia/Shigella, Klebsiella, Streptococcus, and Peptostreptococcus and were impoverished
in Roseburia and other butyrate-producing bacteria of the family Lachnospiraceae  The gut microbiota
of the healthy volunteers were enriched in Bacteroides vulgatus and Bacteroides uniformis. than controls..
