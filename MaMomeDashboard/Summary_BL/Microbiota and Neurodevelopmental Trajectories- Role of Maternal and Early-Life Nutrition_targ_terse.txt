Pregnancy
Pregnancy is a unique period in human life, and both 
the gut and vaginal microbiome have evolved to follow an 
optimum trajectory to support the mother and the devel-
oping fetus and allow for the ideal handover of microbi-
ome at birth, informing maternal and child health out-
comes. . Preclinical Models of Early-Life Microbiota Trajectory
Similar to humans, mice and rat intestinal and vaginal 
microbiota  go  through  compositional  changes  during 
pregnancy,  providing  a  robust  preclinical  model  for 
studying the link between maternal gut environment and 
offspring brain development  Early gestation is 
characterized  by  a  transitional  increase  in  the  relative 
abundance of Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium, which 
in late pregnancy decrease to levels seen in non-pregnant 
mice. In contrast, Bacteroides remain relatively elevated 
throughout  pregnancy    Interestingly,  microbiota . Mode of Nutritional Provision in Early Life
The stability and composition of the early-life gut mi-
crobiota community is also dependent on diet  Ac-
cumulating evidence suggests that breastfeeding and for-
mula-based nutrition leave a distinctive fingerprint in the 
intestinal  microbiota  (Table  2). In preclinical studies, oligosac-
charides have been shown to modulate the gut-brain axis, 
highlighting  the  role  of  breastfeeding  in  neurodevelop-
ment. Early-Life Stress
The impact of stress on the development of the HPA 
axis has been shown to contribute to the programming of 
brain  health  in  later  life    Interestingly,  evidence 
from preclinical studies shows that early-life stress also 
alters  the  microbiota.
