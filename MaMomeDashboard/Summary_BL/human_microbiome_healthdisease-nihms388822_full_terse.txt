Characterizing the microbiome

Tools for studying the metagenome

individuals, and possibly, their disease risks. As sequencing and bioinformatics technologies continue to evolve (see ref 21 for a review of
the state-of-the-art technologies), scientific priorities will include elucidating the ‘core’
metagenome that occupies a specific human niche, and discerning the differences between
normal and diseased hosts.. As an example of the latter, Greenblum et al. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2012 October 01. NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Perspectives

For understanding causation and pathogenesis, model organisms provide an important
approach. For diseases that can be studied
in model organisms, microbiota roles can be explored within the constraints of particular
model systems (Table 2).
