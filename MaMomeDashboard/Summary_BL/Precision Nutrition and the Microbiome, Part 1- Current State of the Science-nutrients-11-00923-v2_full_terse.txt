This vast array of data has contributed
to a deeper understanding of the role of the gut microbiome in health and disease, the factors which
shape it, and the potential to harness its therapeutic potential for optimal health. In this case, consumption
of the Mediterranean diet for two years increased the abundance of Bacteroides and Prevotella which
make up the Bacteriodetes phylum, which has previously been reported to be reduced in obese
In addition, genera with saccharolytic activity, including Faecalibacterium, Roseburia
people 
and Ruminococcus were also increased. Indeed, we have already seen that an animal-based diet high in
fat and protein alters the gut microbiota resulting in an increase in the abundance of bile-tolerant
microorganisms, such as Bilophila, Alistipes and Bacteroides and long-term consumption selects for
a Bacteroides enterotype directly investigated if typically consumed
dietary fatty acids alone could sustain the growth of the human gut microbiota using an in vitro
multi-vessel simulator system of the human small intestine. Additionally, in a mouse model of glioma, mice fed
the ketogenic diet had slightly increased survival compared to mice fed the control diet and showed
signiﬁcant diﬀerences in several key microorganisms  The ketogenic diet generally includes fats

of all chain lengths thus increases in blood ketone levels could be responsible for the observed
gut microbiota changes 

7.2. In another study, soy fed hamsters were found
to have a more consistently diverse microbiota in the small and lower intestine compared to hamsters
fed milk protein isolate and the largest diﬀerences were found within the Bacteriodetes phylum 
Indeed, the milk protein isolate fed group had a greater relative abundance of Bacteroidaceae and
Porphyromonadaceae compared to the soy fed groups. Likewise, tartary buckwheat protein proved capable of
preventing dyslipidemia in mice fed a high fat diet which was not observed for casein  The buck
wheat protein inhibited the growth of E. coli and promoted the growth of Lactobacillus, Enterococcus and
Biﬁdobacterium, the latter of which was closely related to plasma lipids.
