Morowitz et al. Clinical interventions that can preserve gut microbial communities such that a
benefit in overall recovery is realized will require more in-depth analysis of the direct
impact of these interventions on the gut flora. However, during
phosphate depletion, the PhoB system is derepressed and virulence is activated even to the
point of tissue invasion, immune activation, and organ failure  The PhoB and analogous
systems are highly conserved among microbes and offer an opportunity for clinicians to
understand the precise host signals that trigger microbes to transform from indolent
colonizers to lethal pathogens rapidly. Second, it will be important to conduct the necessary studies to
understand how the microbial ecology of the human body is altered during critical illness.
