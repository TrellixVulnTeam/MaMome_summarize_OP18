dramatically expand our knowledge about the functional

sequence was probably retrieved from a representative of
a new genus within the Lentisphaerae phylum, since it has
the highest similarity with V. vadensis (that was
isolated and described after publication of the molecular
study). Today, Methanobrevibacter smithii is recog-
nized as the most abundant, and often an exclusive
methanogen of human gastrointestinal microbiota (Miller
& Wolin, 1986; Dridi et al., According to the current convention, all
Blastocystis isolated from humans are identiﬁed as Blasto-
cystis hominis, although their SSU rRNA gene sequence
analysis showed that nine different phylotypes of these
organisms can be detected in the human gastrointestinal
tract (Arisue et al., If asymptom-
