Number of taxa at different ranks

Taxonomy

No. Aligned 16S rRNA sequences were selected at the RDP
website and analyzed using the RDP Tree Builder tool. Users can navigate through
the hierarchy by clicking on the various taxa. The sequences aver-
aged 1,454 bases in length. Word sizes between 6 and 9 bases were tested in prelim-
inary experiments. As there are fewer possible words of size 8 than size 9, size 8 was chosen
for all further work to reduce memory requirements. The position of a word in
a sequence is ignored. wd} be the set of all possible
eight-character subsequences (words). Nor-
mally, when data consist of independent features, a bootstrap sample size equal
to the number of features in the original sample is chosen. In this case, the
number of completely independent features equals the number of nonoverlap-
ping words. Classiﬁer accuracy versus bootstrap conﬁdence

a Bootstrap conﬁdence reﬂects the frequency of most common assignments
out of 100 bootstrap samplings. For each of the 393 near-full-length sequences misclassiﬁed
at the genus level, we determined the distance to other mem-
bers of the Bergey corpus by calculating the pairwise identity
between sequences using the corresponding aligned sequences
from the RDP website. The comparison
results are presented in a taxonomic hierarchy for easy navigation. Taxa with signiﬁcant differences in representation are
marked. The comparison results can also be displayed in a table sorted by
signiﬁcance. For these se-
quences, the (obviously) incorrect genus assignment was not
considered in the summary statistics, but the results were in-
cluded for higher ranks containing other genera with valid
training sets . The accu-
racy for the 50-base segments was only 94.1% at the phylum
level and decreased dramatically to 51.5% at the genus level. We randomly
chose a test set of 20% of these for leave-one-out
testing, as described above. For many such users, a complete and thorough
phylogenetic analysis may not be an option. It
is unrealistic to imagine that all of these sequences will be
examined in detail. Of the three most rep-
resented phyla (Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria),
the Actinobacteria had the fewest errors (3%, or 31 in 1,220
trials), while the misclassiﬁcation rate for the Firmicutes was
about ﬁve times as high  Within
the Firmicutes, more than two-thirds of the errors occurred in
the class Clostridia  and within that class, the
genus Eubacterium stood out, with 30 misclassiﬁcations in 41
trials (see the supplemental material). Literature searches conﬁrmed that, subsequent
to the publication of version 5.0 of Bergey’s taxonomic outline,
all three had been reevaluated in line with the classiﬁcation
given by the RDP Classiﬁer. Unlike the Seq-
Match nearest-neighbor classiﬁer, the RDP naı¨ve Bayesian
Classiﬁer uses information averaged over the entire genus and
hence is less inﬂuenced by individual misplaced training se-
quences. Classiﬁer accuracy at various query

FIG. Phylogenetic analysis of the Alicyclobacillaceae, including
the genera Sulfobacillus and Alicyclobacillus. Bootstrap conﬁdence estimates above 85% are
shown. They are nearly identical to each
other and 19% different from Z21979. These two sequences are 14% different, and X60602 is now de-
scribed by GenBank as from a Bacillus sp. In bacteriology, although nomenclature is governed by an
ofﬁcial code, there is no deﬁnitive or ofﬁcial taxonomy. We thank Sue Barnes for allowing us access to her unpublished

sequence data and Phillip Neal for constructive suggestions.
