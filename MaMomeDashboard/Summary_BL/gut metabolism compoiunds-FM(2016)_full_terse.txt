Gut Microbiota Metabolome

diseases may develop (Putignani et al., (IBD), obesity,

cancer

The advent of the omics-based systems biology era has opened
a new scenario in the comprehension of the gut ecosystem
by shedding light on its shape, modulation and interplay with
microorganisms, food functionality, and the role of nutrients in
health (Moco et al., Indeed, the metabolomics approach has been applied to
several studies on the gut microbiota, mostly focused on the
exploration of disease-related metabolites in order to obtain
detailed information on the gut metabolic pathways. 2012) the study of its composition helps
discriminate between unhealthy and healthy subjects. Finally, metabolomics represents an unprecedented approach
to collect the complex metabolic interactions between the host
and its commensal microbial partners, oﬀering the opportunity
to deﬁne individual and population phenotypes (Moco et al., However, due to the chemical diversity,

the diﬀerent
properties of metabolites, and the large dynamic range of
metabolite concentrations in samples, it is almost impossible to
measure the complete metabolome with only one technique (De
