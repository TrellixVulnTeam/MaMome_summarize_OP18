the commonality that relates both BV and vaginal pH to HPV
infection (independent of HIV) is the RA of certain Lactobacil-
lus species, most notably L. crispatus. This approach made it possible to incorporate all the available
type-speciﬁc HPV data at each person-visit, as well as time-up-
dated covariates. Figure 2 additionally shows the SDI for each study
visit, and as expected CSTs I through IV-A and V (each dom-
inated by a single Lactobacillus species) had a low SDI, com-
pared with CST IV-B. The ﬁgure also presents the proportion
of oncogenic HPV–positive women-visits for each CST..

Table 3 shows multivariate GEE logistic regression models of
the associations between CSTs and the prevalent detection of
HPV. IV-B, lowa Lactobacillus
I, L. crispatus. Thus, high D-lactic acid levels but not acidity per se could be
associated with reduced infection and/or transmission of
certain viruses, including HPV..

While production of H2O2 has been observed in the major-
ity of L. crispatus isolates, prior data from our group suggest
that the levels of H2O2 produced are likely too limited to great-
ly affect the risk of STIs  especially HPV infection, since
HPV is a nonenveloped virus and, therefore, likely to be resis-
tant to H2O2. L. crispatus has additionally been
noted to have potential immunomodulatory activity.
