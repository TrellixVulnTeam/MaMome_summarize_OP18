Gut Microbiome in Human Health

INTRODUCTION

The human microbiome comprises of collective genomes of
microbiota inhabiting us, namely protozoa, archaea, eukaryotes,
viruses and predominantly bacteria that live symbiotically on and
within various sites of the human body. These extra genes have
added various types of enzymatic proteins which were non-
encoded by the host, and play a critical role in facilitating
host metabolism, thus contributing to the regulation of host
physiology (Hooper and Gordon, 2001). For this, the application of
‘humanized’ gnotobiotic animal model that harbors deﬁned
collection of sequenced microbial communities, has gained
momentum in recent years in microbiome research (Faith
et al., This allows proof-of-mechanism study to examine
the potential
(Turnbaugh et al., 2009b),
antibiotic, environmental toxicants (Stedtfeld et al., 2017) and
host genotypic variation (Ley et al., Although the human microbiome research is still
at its preliminary stage, the ﬁndings are deemed intriguing yet
promising in terms of ﬁlling the knowledge gap in microbiome-
host relationships, and their role in disease pathogenesis, as well
as therapeutic value, which requires more in-depth investigations
to uncover this exciting yet mysterious ﬁeld of research. Gut microbiota and the microbial-synthesized
metabolites are discussed along with their roles in human
wellness and normal functioning. We introduce novel microbiome-
based therapy employed in speciﬁc disease conditions to ‘restore’

wellness and ameliorating dysbiosis-associated diseases. Finally,
we discuss future directions and research areas that require
further elucidation in order to better understand the human
microbiome and its relationship with the host. The predominant functions of gut microbiota and the associated
key metabolites in governing host wellness are depicted in the
following subsections, with some other microbial metabolites
being described in Table 1. Metabolism
Human fecal
sample analysis using 16S ribosomal RNA
and metagenomic sequencing techniques reveal signiﬁcant
enrichment in metabolism of polysaccharides, amino acids,
xenobiotics and micronutrients conferred by gut microbiota,
suggest that these indigenous microbes facilitate host energy
harvesting and metabolic eﬃciency (Gill et al., Gut microbiota is
important in fermenting unabsorbed starch and soluble dietary
ﬁber. The fermented end products exist in the form of a SCFAs. Microbial-synthesized SCFAs contribute 70% of
ATP production in colon, with butyrate as the preferred fuel
for colonocytes (Firmansyah et al., 2011), proving the importance of
butyrate in colonic cellular respiration and energy production. Besides SCFA, gut microbiota-synthesized micronutrients
such as vitamins exhibit beneﬁcial value for both microbial
and host metabolisms. Vitamin-K-producing gut bacteria
namely Bacteroides fragilis, Eubacterium lentum, Enterobacter
agglomerans, Serratia marcescens, and Enterococcus faecium
(Fernandez and Collins, 1987; Cooke et al., Deﬁciency of vitamins B5 and B12 have been linked to
several disorders such as gastrointestinal discomfort, insomnia,
neuropsychological and hematological disorders (Andres et al., These cholesterol
derivatives are synthesized in the liver, followed by conjugation
with taurine or glycine prior to storage in the gall bladder
and subsequent secretion into duodenum to aid digestion,
cholesterol and lipid metabolisms. In humans, 95% of bile
acids are reabsorbed at distal ileum (Staels and Fonseca, 2009). 2014) and the
unabsorbed secondary bile acids are excreted by the host (Sorg
and Sonenshein, 2008). Both primary and secondary bile acids
are able to activate host nuclear FXR signaling, which in turn
regulates the bile acids production, glucose metabolism, and
potentially hepatic autophagy (Lee et al., Secondary bile acids serve as a potent activator of TGR5 (a
member of the Rhodopsin-like subfamily of GPCRs) which is
widely expressed on diﬀerent tissues including in gall bladder,
liver, spleen,
intestine, and the immune cells. Metabolites
