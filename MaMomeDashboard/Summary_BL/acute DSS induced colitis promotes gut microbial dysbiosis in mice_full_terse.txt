Even though they have limitations
like all other models, they present some important
immunological and histopathological aspects of IBD in
humans  The most widely used and characterized
experimental model of erosion and inﬂammation related
to UC in mice is the dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-
induced colitis, which is developed by DSS administration
either in the drinking water or via intragastric
catheter  The DSS induces a reproducible
acute colitis  however, there is some controversy
regarding the type of inﬂammation that is induced. The aim of the present study was to utilize Illumina
sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and inferred meta-
genomics by open source software PICRUSt (Phyloge-
netic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of
Unobserved States  to investigate differences in
microbiome composition and function in the fecal and
colonic mucosa of mice treated with 5% DSS for 5 days. The PCR reaction for each
sample was performed in duplicate and contained 1.0 ml
of pre-normalized DNA, 1.0 ml of each forward and
reverse primers  12 ml HPLC grade water (Fisher
Scientiﬁc, Ottawa, ON, Canada) and 10 ml 5 Prime Hot
MasterMix (5 Prime,
Inc., Gaithersburg, MD, USA). (cid:1) 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA,Weinheim

J. Basic Microbiol. b) Colonic mucosal bacterial diversity is not different between
colitic and non-colitic samples, suggesting that both sample groups had similar bacterial species richness and evenness. Partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) of bacterial communities comparing taxa that were associated with the control or
DSS treatments in the mice’s (a) fecal samples and (b) colon mucosal samples.
