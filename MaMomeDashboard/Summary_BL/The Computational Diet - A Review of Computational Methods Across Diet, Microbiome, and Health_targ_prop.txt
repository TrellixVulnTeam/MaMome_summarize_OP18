For example, species of beneﬁcial bacteria
such as Lactobacillus and Biﬁdobacterium have been found to be
dominant in breastfed infants while species of harmful bacteria
such as Clostridium, Granulicatella, Citrobacter, Enterobacter,
and Bilophila have been found to be dominant in formula-fed
infants (Bäckhed et al., In addition, breastfed babies have
higher gut microbial diversity compared to formula-fed babies,
and several studies indicate that the diversity of bacteria is directly
connected to health (Wang et al., Answer: No, read counts cannot be
compared across samples. Solutions: (I) Convert read counts to relative abundances before comparison. (
