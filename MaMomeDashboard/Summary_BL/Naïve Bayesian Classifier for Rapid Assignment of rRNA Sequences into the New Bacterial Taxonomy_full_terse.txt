Number of taxa at different ranks

Taxonomy

No. Users can navigate through
the hierarchy by clicking on the various taxa. For each of the 393 near-full-length sequences misclassiﬁed
at the genus level, we determined the distance to other mem-
bers of the Bergey corpus by calculating the pairwise identity
between sequences using the corresponding aligned sequences
from the RDP website. Taxa with signiﬁcant differences in representation are
marked. Three misclassiﬁcations made by the RDP Classiﬁer are high-
lighted, with the original (release 5.0) description appended with a
corrected description. The online
version of the Classiﬁer returns results for submissions of up to
10,000 user sequences in a few minutes and provides both
summary and detailed classiﬁcation assignments.
