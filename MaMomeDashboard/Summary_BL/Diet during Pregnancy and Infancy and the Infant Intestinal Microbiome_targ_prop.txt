In unadjusted analyses of 4 genera selected a priori based
on prior literature suggesting associations with early diet and
health outcomes,7-10,22-25 we found that high maternal intake
of vegetables and low intake of processed meats and deep fried
foods was inversely associated with Bacteroides spp (decrease. †Dietary variables: infant breastfeeding vs formula feeding and infant solid food. Excluding race/ethnicity
from the model, the interaction between breastfeeding status
and maternal education was not signiﬁcant for either
Biﬁdobacterium spp (P = .45) or Lactobacillus spp (P = .73),
further supporting stronger associations of microbial differ-
ences by infant diet group with race/ethnicity than maternal
education..

We identiﬁed signiﬁcant differences in relative abun-
dances of taxa between breastfed and formula- fed infants in
adjusted analyses stratiﬁed by race/ethnicity (Figure 3 and
Table VI; available at www.jpeds.com). We note overlap and heterogeneity in the response
to breastfeeding among the top associations among taxa and
diet. These associations are consistent with ob-
servations that both Lactobacillus and Staphylococcus spp are
present in breast milk and grow in the presence of human milk
oligosaccharides.27-29.
