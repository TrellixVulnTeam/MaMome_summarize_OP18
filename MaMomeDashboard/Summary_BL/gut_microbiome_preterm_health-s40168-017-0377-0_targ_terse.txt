Variance and abundance of taxa across three microbiota
phases
Taxonomic analysis of all samples identified 16 phyla, 38
classes, 73 orders, 158 families, and 383 genera. Compos-
itional differences across the phases at all taxonomic levels
were characterized and pairwise comparisons were made
between phases. 1f, which
represents the abundance of genera relative to bar size. Consistent with other studies, we determined that this
programmed, non-random developmental succession of
microbiota is largely determined by PMA  What
drives this patterned succession toward a homeostatic
relationship between the infant and colonizing microbiota
is not known, but likely involves complex interactions be-
tween the mucosal immune system as well as metabolic
interactions within the gut microbial community and the
surrounding tissue and microenvironment, which remain
dynamic during periods of gastrointestinal development in
early life. 16S ribosomal
RNA (rRNA) was amplified with Phusion High-Fidelity
polymerase (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) and
dual indexed primers specific to the V3-V4 hypervari-
able regions (319F: 5′ ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG
3′; 806R: 3′ ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG 5′) 
Amplicons were pooled and paired-end sequenced on
an Illumina MiSeq (Illumina, San Diego, CA) in the
University of Rochester Genomics Research Center.
