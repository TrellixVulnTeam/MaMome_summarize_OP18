FEMS Microbiology Reviews, 2016, Vol. Although the microbiota similarity between mice and
humans at the phylum level is remarkable, at the species
level, many differences are found (Dethlefsen, McFall-Ngai and
Relman 2007). The age at which the treatment is adminis-
trated is important since antibiotic treatment of mice at the age
of weaning results in long-term alteration of their gut microbial
communities, which does not occur in adult animals (Cho et al. The microbiota on day 17 closely
resembles the microbiota one year after weaning when mice are
kept under similar conditions. Another cell type that crucially regulates
lymphoid genesis in response to bacteria are RORct+ ILCs called
lymphoid tissue-inducer cells (Eberl 2012). In addition, embryos from different
