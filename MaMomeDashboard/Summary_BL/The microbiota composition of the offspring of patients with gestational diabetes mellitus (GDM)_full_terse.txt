(Rho = 0.49) was no longer confirmed in the multivariate model, while the inverse association

abundance of the Blautia oligotypes increased during the pregnancy and were lower in the
infants (S4A Fig). Nutritional recommendations were given to our women between 24â€“28 weeks of gesta-
tional age, at the time of the oral glucose challenge test and GDM diagnosis  Only 34.1%
of our participants resulted compliant to the nutritional advice; indeed, dietary adherence and
nutritional habits at the end of pregnancy did not influence the offspring microbiota. Enrolment characteristics and pregnancy outcomes of the GDM women. Methodology: Valentina Ponzo, Ilario Ferrocino, Rosalba Rosato, Simona Bo.
