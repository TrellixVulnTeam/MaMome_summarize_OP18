the commonality that relates both BV and vaginal pH to HPV
infection (independent of HIV) is the RA of certain Lactobacil-
lus species, most notably L. crispatus. Following collec-
tion, CVLs were refrigerated at <10°C until transported to the
laboratory on ice within 4 hours, where they were vortexed gent-
ly and aliquoted under a hood (using sterile conditions) into
1-mL units and then frozen at −80°C until requested for testing. Detection of HPV DNA
HPV DNA was detected with a L1 consensus primer MY09/
MY11/HMB01 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Distribution of relative abundance (RA) of Lactobacillus species. Histograms of Lactobacillus species as a group (Fig-
ure 1) and individual species suggested similar cut points of
low (<7.5%), medium RA. All covariates except study group were time
dependent. RESULTS

Select characteristics of the cohort at the index visit are shown in
Table 1. The 338R primer included a unique sequence tag
to barcode each sample. The median number of CVLs tested for both micro-
biome and HPV in the current study was 6 (range, 2–11); the
median follow-up time was 82.8 person-months (range, 15.6–
137.7 person-months). Figure 2 displays a heat map of the RA data for the 25 most
abundant genera or species and how they cluster within each
CST. Heat map of microbiome relative abundances and Shannon diversity index. A, Heat map of the relative percent abundance of bacterial taxa, by community state
type (CST) and the presence of oncogenic human papillomavirus (oncHPV). Each vertical line represents a person-visit,
with relative abundance indicated by the shade of green as shown in the key. Reference

excluded from this substudy. Abbreviations: BV, bacterial vaginosis; CI, confidence interval; OR, odds ratio. Lactobacillus species against STIs, most of that research
preceded widespread use of methods for comprehensively
assessing the cervicovaginal microbiome  The growing ev-
idence of species-speciﬁc (eg, L. crispatus–related) relationships
between the cervicovaginal microbiome and HPV infection ar-
gues against a signiﬁcant role of pH, since production of lactic
acid is a common attribute of lactobacilli as a group, and our
data showed that the greatest association with pH was with
the RA of Lactobacillus species, not for L. crispatus RA or
CSTs dominated by L. crispatus. Bacteriocins are riboso-
mally synthesized antimicrobial peptides and proteins 
Relatively little has been written regarding the bacteriocins
produced by cervicovaginal Lactobacillus species, with most
of the bacteriocin literature to date focused on Lactobacillus
species inhabiting the gut. L. crispatus has additionally been
noted to have potential immunomodulatory activity. For

All models were adjusted for age, study group, highly active antiretroviral therapy use, number of recent sex partners, smoking status, condom use, lifetime sex partners, Trichomonas vaginalis
infection in the past 6 months, Candida infection in the past 6 months, or other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the past 6 months. In summary, our results suggest a beneﬁcial effect of L. crisp-
atus on the burden of HPV in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected
women that is unrelated to pH. Further research to better un-
derstand these relationships is strongly warranted, including
large prospective cohort studies and laboratory research to un-
derstand the mechanisms that underlie the relation of the cer-
vicovaginal microbiota with HPV infection. WIHS data collection is also supported by
UL1-TR000004 (UCSF CTSA) and UL1-TR000454 (Atlanta CTSA). All other au-
thors report no potential conﬂicts.
