Introduction
Asthma is a common chronic disorder during pregnancy, affecting between 8% and 13% of pregnant
women 
is often a comorbid condition with food and environmental allergies  Asthma
exacerbation rates during pregnancy are high  and more severe asthma or poor symptom control have
been associated with low birthweight  A greater risk for childhood asthma following uncontrolled
versus controlled maternal asthma during pregnancy has been reported  These variations in risk to the
offspring point to a potential in utero influence of maternal asthma. Using the adjusted rank transform (ART) nonparametric test
for interaction  the p-value for the interaction between infant sex and maternal prenatal asthma on
Lactobacillus abundance was 0.001. With the
exception of Firmicutes being less abundant in female infants born to women with asthma ( p=0.03), no
other differences were evident in phylum abundance, microbial richness or diversity between infants born
to women with versus those without prenatal asthma (supplementary figure S1, supplementary table S1). The p-values <0.1 are reported and
p-values <0.05 are indicated in bold. Â¶: Based on the ART test, the p-value for the interaction term
between prenatal asthma and infant sex on Lactobacillus abundance was 0.003 for maternal atopy
comorbidity and 0.06 for overweight comorbidity. A.L. Kozyrskyj conceived the study and obtained funding, designed the analyses and wrote the final
version of the manuscript.
