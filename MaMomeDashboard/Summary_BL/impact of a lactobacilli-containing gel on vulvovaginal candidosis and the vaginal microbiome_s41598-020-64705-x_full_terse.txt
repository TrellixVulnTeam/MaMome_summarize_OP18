First we explored in detail the in vitro inhibitory effects of a selection of LGC strains against growth and 
pathogenic properties (adhesion to vaginal cells and hyphae formation) of Candida albicans. Results
In vitro selection of LGc strains for anti-Candida effects. In most women the lactobacillus that 
dominated the bacterial community before treatment (visit 1) was also dominant at the end of the study, after the 
treatment (visit 4), indicating the applied lactobacilli had a temporary effect on the microbiome (Supplemental 
Fig. Thus, our data suggest that the use of the RM targeting 
the fungal community might have a negative effect on the present bacteria, diminishing numbers of lactoba-
cilli, which are the hallmark of a healthy vaginal microbiome. Briefly, DNA was extracted from the vaginal lavage samples (PowerFecal DNA extraction kit, Qiagen) and sub-
jected to respectively 25 and 30 cycles of PCR amplification targeting the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene (for 
bacteria; Supplementary Table 2) and the ITS2 region (for fungi; Supplementary Table 3)38,39. A 
species annotation was added to each ASV by listing the species of all 16 S rRNA sequences in the database that 
showed an exact match to the ASV sequence.
