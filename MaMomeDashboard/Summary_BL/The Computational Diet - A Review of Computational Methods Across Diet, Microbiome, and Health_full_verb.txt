Eetemadi et al. In this article, we summarize the research that has been
done related to DGMH, with a focus on DGMH data and
computational methods. 2019)]. Several studies have demonstrated that the
human intestinal microbiota is seeded before birth (Stinson et al., 2006), psoriatic arthritis (Scher et al., Jackkniﬁng and bootstrapping are
used to estimate the bias in diversity estimates, particularly
when estimating the number of species (i.e., species richness)
in samples (Smith and van Belle, 1984). A dietary record
(DR) can also be used where data collection is done when
food is consumed (e.g., using smartphones),which minimalizes
reliance on participant’s memory. 2016;

MetaPhlAn2(Q) (Truong et al., Although several pipelines provide this functionality,
it has been found inadmissible for metagenomics microbiome

TABLE 3 | Key challenges that arise in microbiome data analysis with examples and suggested solutions. II) If an optimization
problem is deﬁned using read counts, add constraint for total counts per sample. Solutions: (I) Use dimensionality reduction such as PCA prior to regression. ( For example, when marker gene sequencing is
used, quantities relating to the amounts of functional genes
in the microbiome are not directly available (i.e., missing). 2013), help to mitigate this through gene imputation based on
annotated databases. Correlation analysis
can be considered a special case of regression with a single
input variable. For example, a sparse CCA is
applied to investigate correlations between the gut microbiome
and metabolome features in type 1 diabetes (Kostic et al., Computational Diet, Microbiome and Health

value of a loss function that calculates the overall error in model
predictions. Exploratory
factor analysis (EFA) is used to identify unobserved latent
features called factors to explain the correlations among observed
features (Yong and Pearce, 2013). For downstream supervised learning tasks, we
are often interested in the maximum amount of DR without

algorithms often require the number of clusters to be provided as
input. Such
a knowledge-based RS was devised in a recent study involving
28 patients with Crohn’s disease and 26 healthy individuals
(Bauer and Thiele, 2018). The third challenge relates to the computational
complexity of in silico simulations, which increases as host
and microbial GENREs become more comprehensive. Several challenges arise when building content-based RSs. Applicability of each method depends
on research objectives and data availability.
