Defects in host genes controlling bacterial homeostasis or al-
terations of the gut microbiota composition have been associ-
ated with complex diseases, including inflammatory bowel dis-
ease (IBD), diabetes mellitus (Pflughoeft and Versalovic 2012)
and asthma (Maslowski et al. Finally, since immune struc-
tures in GF mice remain immature, much of our understanding
of host–microbe interactions involved in the development of the
immune system arose from the study of GF animals and is dis-
cussed in more detail later in this review..

An important limitation in murine microbial studies is the dif-
ference in bacterial composition between mice and humans. As in humans, the two most abundant bacte-
rial phyla in C57BL6/J mice are the Firmicutes (60–80% of se-
quences) and the Bacteroidetes  however, 85% of the
murine sequences represent species that have not been detected
in humans (Ley et al. 2007)..

Although considerable literature exists about microbiota
transfer into GF animals, little is known about transferring mi-
crobiota into animals with non-GF intestines. Transplantation has also been used in
mouse models of enteric infections. The origin of the mice is extremely
important because laboratory mice are available as both outbred
stocks and inbred strains from various vendors.
