As in the gut, the vaginal microbiome undergoes signiﬁcant
changes during pregnancy, including a signiﬁcant decrease in
overall diversity, increased stability (the community composition
changes over time), and enrichment with Lactobacillus species
(Aagaard et al., 2015)..

A study characterizing the vaginal microbiota of pregnant
and non-pregnant African-Americans reported that during
pregnancy, one of
the changes is dominance of a single
Lactobacillus species over others (Romero et al., Additionally, Candida levels were signiﬁcantly
higher during middle and late pregnancy compared to non-
pregnant women, further demonstrating a higher prevalence of
periodontal pathogens in pregnancy..

The placenta is one of the most poorly understood human organs,
particularly with regard to the presence of microbes within it. It is important to note that the microbial density present in
the placenta is very low, requiring precise veriﬁcation in all
cases that research results are not due to contamination. Additionally, presence of certain
fungi, such as vaginal colonization of Candida albicans even
when asymptomic, is correlated to higher rates of preterm birth

THE FETUS.
