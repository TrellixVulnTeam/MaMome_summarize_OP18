proﬁle identiﬁed based on sequencing different
variable regions. Furthermore, the number of Lactobacil-
lus species detected (and thus relative abun-
dance) will vary depending on the 16S region
sequenced, with V1V3 revealing more unique
Lactobacillus operational
taxonomic units
(OTUs) as compared with V3V5 (Huse et al. However, re-
cent studies have shown the caution that must
be used when performing analysis such as CSTs
(Koren et al. Vaginal samples collected
from a cross-sectional survey of gravid subjects
from 18 wk gestation to term or delivery, and
all samples were collected by a single physician
who also conducted the HMP sampling for
50% of subjects. pared with the HMP nonpregnant reference
subjects, we found that pregnancy was associat-
ed with an altered vaginal microbiome and
marked by a decrease in alpha diversity at the
subgenus level . Initial studies of the vaginal micro-
biome showed that African-American women
have a higher prevalence of vaginal CSTs con-
sisting of Lactobacillus species (Ravel et al. This study
shows that the maternal microbiome at birth
and postpartum may be critical in the establish-
ment and development of the neonatal micro-
biome via horizontal transmission..

When directly examining the intestinal mi-
crobiome of infants born via cesarean or vaginal
delivery, culture-based microbiological tech-
niques have shown differences in the coloniza-
tion of the neonatal
intestinal microbiome,
particularly of Biﬁdobacterium-like bacteria,
Lactobacillus-like bacteria, and Bacteriodes fra-
gilis (Gro¨nlund et al. Our ﬁnding of Fuso-
bacteria to be a relatively abundant taxon in the
placenta supports the hypothesis of hematoge-
nous spread from the oral cavity to the placenta
