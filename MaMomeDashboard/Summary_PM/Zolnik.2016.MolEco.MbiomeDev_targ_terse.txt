relationships
between internal microorganisms and I. scapularis have
focused on commonly studied human pathogens. For
example, infection of blacklegged ticks by A. phagocy-
tophilum (the causative agent of granulocytic anaplas-
mosis in humans) has been shown to induce protein
expression that increases cold tolerance and, depend-
ing on weather patterns, may aid in tick survival
(Neelakanta et al. The relative abundance
of non-Rickettsia taxa increased along developmental
stages (i.e. larvae to nymphs to adults) with the excep-
tion of adult females, which displayed the highest rela-
tive abundance of Rickettsia of all ﬁeld-collected life
stages . Freshly hatched larvae also had a high
relative abundance of Rickettsia . Wolbachia was the genus with the second highest. We interpret this as an indication of sufﬁcient evolution-
ary informativeness
identiﬁcation of our
sequences at the clade level grosso modo, combined with
the observation of greater divergence patterns of this
locus in Rickettsia.
