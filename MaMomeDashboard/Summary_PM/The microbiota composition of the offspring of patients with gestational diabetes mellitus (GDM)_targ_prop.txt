The possibility of early modulation of the offspring gut microbiota by acting on specific
maternal factors and/or characteristics is of potential great interest. Maternal fasting glucose concentrations were correlated positively with the rela-
tive abundance of phylum Actinobacteria and genus Acinetobacter, and negatively with the
phylum Bacteroidetes and the genus Prevotella  We hypothesized that maternal dietary
habits and metabolic characteristics may impact on the offspring gut microbiota..

Blautia, Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium were extracted and entropy analysis and oligotyping
were carried out since these were the only OTUs showing higher level of entropy able to
obtain sub-OTUs. A cladogram of representative sequences was generated using the ANVIOs
software . In multiple regression analyses, a significant association
between breastfeeding and the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium in the infant gut micro-
biota was found (β = 22.9; 95%CI = 10.1–35.7; P = 0.0017)..

In order to explore the possible mother-to-infant gut microbiota transmission at sub-OTUs
level, we carried out oligotyping on sequences of Blautia, Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium
since these were the only genera showing a Shannon entropy index sufficient to identify all. The Clostridiales order includes several genera and in particular Roseburia and. Plot showing the sequence distribution in GDM patients at enrolment (red bars), study end
