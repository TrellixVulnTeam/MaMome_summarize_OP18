be due to the fact that some Lactobacillus species have bactericidal
activities against other species, ensuring their predominance and
low variability, which may help in protection against infections
during pregnancy (Spurbeck and Arvidson, 2010)..

vaginal communities were more similar to the gut microbiota
communities, with Lactobacillus being replaced by various
including Peptoniphilus, Prevotella, and
anaerobic bacteria,
Anaerococcus. When
comparing the abundance of seven common bacterial species
in the oral cavity of non-pregnant women, early pregnancy,
mid-pregnancy, and late pregnancy, the total viable microbial
counts in all stages of pregnancy were higher than those of the
non-pregnant women, especially in early pregnancy (Fujiwara
et al., Alternatively, it was suggested that
hematogenous spread of oral microbes to the placenta might be
a driver of preterm birth (Aagaard et al., 2014)..

is
accumulating, one emerging question is whether these bacterial
communities are diﬀerent in cases of pregnancy complications
such as preterm births. This, together with a higher abundance of
Staphylococcus in C-section newborns compared to vaginal
births, may explain why 64–82% of reported cases of methicillin-
resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) skin infections in
newborns occur in C-section delivered infants (Centers for
Disease Prevention, 2006)..

Interestingly, the mode of delivery has an eﬀect on the infant’s
oral microbiome, as well (Lif Holgerson et al., The
remaining small sugars can be further metabolized by glycolytic
microbes present in the infant,
including lactate-producing
bacteria such as Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and Enterococcus..

The weaning period with transition to solid foods has
a signiﬁcant role in shaping the gut bacterial composition.
