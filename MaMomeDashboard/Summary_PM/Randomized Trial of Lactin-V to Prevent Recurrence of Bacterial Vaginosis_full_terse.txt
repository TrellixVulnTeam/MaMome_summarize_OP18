Lactobacillus crispatus  CTV-05  (Lactin-V,  Osel) 
is  a  live  biotherapeutic  product  that  contains  a 
naturally occurring vaginal strain of L. crispatus. Copyright Â© 2020 Massachusetts Medical Society. Before  un-
blinding of the treatment-group assignments oc-
curred, a case-review committee identified par-
ticipants who had had protocol deviations, such 
as the use of prohibited medications, trial visits 
outside  the  protocol-specified  time  window,  or 
poor adherence to the assigned treatment; these 
participants were excluded from the per-protocol 
analyses (see the Methods section in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). Secondary Outcomes
Among  the  participants  without  known  recur-
rence of bacterial vaginosis by week 12, a total 
of 13 of 106 participants in the Lactin-V 
group and 7 of 42 participants in the pla-
cebo  group  had  a  recurrence  by  week  24. A total of 7 participants (4 in the Lactin-
V group and 3 in the placebo group) had a severe 
grade 3 adverse event, one of which was reported 
as a serious adverse event (Lactin-V group) (Ta-
ble S9). T h e  n e w   e ng l a n d   j o u r na l   o f  m e dic i n e
