secrete  antimicrobial  compounds  into  the  lumen  of  the  small

is  known  to  be  low  in  mouse  gut  microbiota  (Hildebrand  et  al., 2009)..

Recently, a study by Krych et al. 2013),  being  dominated  by
Lachnospiraceae  and  Ruminococcaceae  or  Bacteroidaceae  and
Enterobacteriaceae, respectively. 2013), in which low species-richness individuals
were  found  to  have  more  pronounced  inflammation,  and  to  be
dominated by Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, the same bacterial
groups that dominated the ‘inflamed’ mouse enterotype..

Obesity
The influence of diet on the gut microbiota has received increasing
research attention over recent years. Some common trends
have emerged from this research. On the other hand, a study on wild
mice by Wang et al. Mouse studies have also detected changes in abundance of bacterial
phylotypes that solely happen in mice, such as of Tenericutes and
Deferribacteriaceae (Nagalingam et al., 2008) or in
the abundance of Roseburia (Willing et al., have  shown  that
hosting wild mice in a laboratory environment on chow diet causes
a shift in enterotypes, from the original Bacteroides-dominated (with
microbial metabolism more dedicated to protein degradation) to the
Robinsoneilla-dominated 
to  carbohydrate
degradation) enterotype (Wang et al., Furthermore,  it  was  hypothesized  that  the
differences  between  mice  and  rats  in  recapitulating  the  human
donors’  microbiota  is  due  to  the  intrinsic  differences  in  genetic
backgrounds of the recipient models, which might control for the
establishment of the transferred microbiota (Wos-Oxley et al., For example, in the study by Yanabe et al.,
