In this review, we describe the pronounced microbial
changes
female, as well as
in the pregnant
provide an overview of the initial exposure of the fetus to
microbiota—from the placenta,
through birth and infancy. This may
be due to the fact that some Lactobacillus species have bactericidal
activities against other species, ensuring their predominance and
low variability, which may help in protection against infections
during pregnancy (Spurbeck and Arvidson, 2010)..

vaginal communities were more similar to the gut microbiota
communities, with Lactobacillus being replaced by various
including Peptoniphilus, Prevotella, and
anaerobic bacteria,
Anaerococcus. Alternatively, it was suggested that
hematogenous spread of oral microbes to the placenta might be
a driver of preterm birth (Aagaard et al., The notion of early microbial colonization of the fetus suggests
that from the very beginning of development, there are dual
interactions between the developing host and microbiota, and
that there is some type of early inheritance of the maternal
microbial components..

Just like the placenta and fetus, the meconium was considered
in the past to be sterile (Koleva et al., Moreover, the administration of probiotics (including
Lactobacillus sp.) The
remaining small sugars can be further metabolized by glycolytic
microbes present in the infant,
including lactate-producing
bacteria such as Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and Enterococcus..

The weaning period with transition to solid foods has
a signiﬁcant role in shaping the gut bacterial composition.
