First we explored in detail the in vitro inhibitory effects of a selection of LGC strains against growth and 
pathogenic properties (adhesion to vaginal cells and hyphae formation) of Candida albicans. When applying the strains simultaneously with C. albi-
cans, the strains were able to reduce adhesion of C. albicans, e.g. L. pentosus KCA1 by 78.0% . Subsequently, we evaluated whether L. plantarum 
WCFS1, L. pentosus KCA1 and L. rhamnosus GG formulated in the gel were able to modulate the vaginal micro-
biome over a four-week period in 20 patients suffering from acute VVC . www.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/Figure 1. The other ASVs belong to the genera Gardnerella, Atopobium, Prevotella, Aerococcus and 
Streptococcus. This first ASV likely corresponds to L. pentosus KCA1, L. plantarum WCFS1 or 
both, which were supplemented in the gel, as this ASV was only found at visit 2 (16/20 samples, during treatment 
with the gel) and visit 3  Similarly, LGC 7, found in 12 of the 20 visit 2 samples and one visit 3 
sample, likely corresponded to L. rhamnosus GG, also supplemented in the gel.
