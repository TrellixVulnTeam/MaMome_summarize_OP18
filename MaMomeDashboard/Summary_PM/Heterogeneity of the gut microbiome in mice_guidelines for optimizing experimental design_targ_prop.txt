Defects in host genes controlling bacterial homeostasis or al-
terations of the gut microbiota composition have been associ-
ated with complex diseases, including inflammatory bowel dis-
ease (IBD), diabetes mellitus (Pflughoeft and Versalovic 2012)
and asthma (Maslowski et al. In addition, simply cohousing lean and obese animals prevented
the obese phenotype and was associated with transfer of Bac-
teroidales, suggesting a phenotypic impact of horizontal micro-
bial transfer (Ridaura et al. This suggests that bacteria may play a protective
role in the metabolism of DSS, or that GF mice respond less ef-
ficient because of their immature intestinal immune system. Together, these data sug-
gest a highly specific coexistence and mutual interaction be-
tween species-associated microbiota and the host immune sys-
tem, and that microbiota–host interactions in humans cannot
be completely mirrored in ‘humanized’ mice..

Although considerable literature exists about microbiota
transfer into GF animals, little is known about transferring mi-
crobiota into animals with non-GF intestines.
