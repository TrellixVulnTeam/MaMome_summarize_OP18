Defects in host genes controlling bacterial homeostasis or al-
terations of the gut microbiota composition have been associ-
ated with complex diseases, including inflammatory bowel dis-
ease (IBD), diabetes mellitus (Pflughoeft and Versalovic 2012)
and asthma (Maslowski et al. In addition, simply cohousing lean and obese animals prevented
the obese phenotype and was associated with transfer of Bac-
teroidales, suggesting a phenotypic impact of horizontal micro-
bial transfer (Ridaura et al. ILCs regulate barrier integrity and therefore the direct physical
border between microbiome and underlying lamina propria cells
through secretion of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor and
interferon..

Unexpectedly, individual mice from certain strains, for ex-
ample C3HRI, DBAJR and WSB, appear to be more similar in their
microbiota than other strains such as C57BL6/J (Friswell et al. Essentially, the
strong protection observed in Casp1-null mice against a lethal
lipopolysaccharide challenge was found to be mainly due to this
inactivating passenger mutation in the Casp11 gene..

Besides strain and gender differences, investigators have
studied the effects of the allelic absence of specific genes on
the intestinal microbiota by comparing knockout with wild-type
mice. the exact contribution to experimental out-
comes is poorly understood.
