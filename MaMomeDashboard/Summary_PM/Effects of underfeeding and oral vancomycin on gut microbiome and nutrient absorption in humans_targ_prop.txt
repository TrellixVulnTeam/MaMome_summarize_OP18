in  phylum-  or  genus-level  relative  abundance  between  diet  arms, 
with the exception of the Verrucomicrobia phylum which was sig-
nificantly  increased  during  UF  (Extended  Data  Fig. Metagenomic sequencing confirmed the enrichment for A. 
muciniphila  during  UF  ,  and  a  trend  towards  increased  A. 
muciniphila abundance in the vancomycin group (P = 0.25)..

Mechanistic insights into host–microbiome interactions relevant 
to  metabolic  disease  in  UF  versus  OF  and  vancomycin  versus 
placebo  interventions. Each data point shows the mean and standard deviation of samples from each 
subject (n = 70 samples from 24 subjects; P < 0.0001, determined using Adonis comparing effect of treatment and accounting for repeated measures 
per subject). Two bacterial 
species consistently changed in response to both perturbations: A. muciniphila and an unidentified species belonging to Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group..

Our  results  provide  insights  into  potential  mechanisms  that 
could explain the increased stool calories loss.
