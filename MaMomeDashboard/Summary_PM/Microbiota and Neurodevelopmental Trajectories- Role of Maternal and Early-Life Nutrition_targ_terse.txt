Pregnancy
Pregnancy is a unique period in human life, and both 
the gut and vaginal microbiome have evolved to follow an 
optimum trajectory to support the mother and the devel-
oping fetus and allow for the ideal handover of microbi-
ome at birth, informing maternal and child health out-
comes. . In contrast, Bacteroides remain relatively elevated 
throughout  pregnancy    Interestingly,  microbiota . Gut  bacterial  composi-
tion  of  infants  exclusively  breastfed  is  characterized  by 
higher relative abundance of Bacteroides and Bifidobacte-
rium compared to the one from formula-fed infants [108, 
116]. Furthermore, breastfeeding had a positive effect on 
myelination and increased general, verbal and non-verbal 
cognitive abilities during childhood  The implica-
tions of these findings are still unclear, but longitudinal 
studies are starting to shed light on the effect of early-life 
nutrition on the temporal course of microbiota matura-
tion. . Administration  of  the  human  milk  oligosaccha-
rides 3’Sialyllactose to mice 
exposed  to  social  disruption  prevented  stress-induced  
colonic  microbial  disruption  and  anxiety-like  behavior 
  Furthermore,  fructo-oligosaccharide  (FOS)  and 
GOS administration attenuated corticosterone release in 
response to an acute stressor and protected the mice from 
the impact of chronic stress on the microbiota  . Early-Life Stress
The impact of stress on the development of the HPA 
axis has been shown to contribute to the programming of 
brain  health  in  later  life    Interestingly,  evidence 
from preclinical studies shows that early-life stress also 
alters  the  microbiota.
