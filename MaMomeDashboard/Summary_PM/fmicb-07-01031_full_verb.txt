Pregnancy and the Microbiome

that we are born germ free (Tissier, 1900) and is still the belief
of many physicians, numerous pieces of evidence now cast
doubt on this hypothesis, and suggest that a bacterial presence
already exists in the feto-placental unit (Hu et al., 2012), of which the dominant bacterial phyla are Firmicutes and
Bacteroidetes (Rajilic-Stojanovic et al., In many ways,

the metabolic changes associated with
pregnancy are similar to those that occur in the metabolic

syndrome,

third trimester of pregnancy. Overall, most studies showed signiﬁcant alterations in gut
microbiota during pregnancy, with correlations to initial weight
and diet, weight gain, inﬂammation, and metabolic parameters. Only a few studies have
studied this timeframe, and it would therefore be of interest
to investigate how long the postpartum transition period lasts,
and whether a return to baseline microbial populations ever
occurs. The vaginal microbiome is dominated by many species
including Lactobacillus and members of
the Clostridiales,
Bacteriodales, and Actinomycetales (Aagaard et al., It has been suggested that

the emergence of microbiome research and the realization that
changes in the maternal microbiome compositions occur during
pregnancy, it has been suggested that there may be correlations
between the microbial communities present, and the health of the
pregnancy (Mysorekar and Cao, 2014). When studying the vaginal microbiome, Romero et al. and

vaginal microbiota during pregnancy, such as decreased levels
of Lactobacillus sp., Alternatively, it was suggested that
hematogenous spread of oral microbes to the placenta might be
a driver of preterm birth (Aagaard et al., found no signiﬁcant diﬀerences between
the meconium microbiota of vaginal vs. Cesarean section (C-
section) delivered infants (Gosalbes et al., Generally, the gut microbiota of vaginally born infants is ﬁrst
colonized by bacteria from the maternal vagina, characterized
by enrichment in the Prevotella, Sneathia, and Lactobacillus
genera, and also includes bacteria present in the maternal
gut (Mackie et al., The infants born by C-section also exhibit delayed colonization
of the phylum Bacteroidetes, and lower alpha diversity during
the ﬁrst 2 years of life (Jakobsson et al., The

compositions of C-section vs. vaginal delivered infants have
led scientists to expose C-section born infants to vaginal ﬂuids
containing microbiota at birth and test the eﬀects on the infant’s
microbial composition up to 30 days later (Dominguez-Bello
et al., In summary,

it appears evident that the mode of birth
aﬀects the newborn’s microbiome composition (Figure 2). More speciﬁcally, elevation of progesterone
may increase gut permeability, which could assist in bacterial
transmission into the bloodstream and subsequently into the
mother’s mammary glands (Jeurink et al., A) Text refers to changes in vaginal birth vs. Caesarian section (B). The shift to solid food, as
well as increased exposure to xenobiotics, change the microbial
populations and enriches species which are able to utilize
nutrients such as carbohydrates, and are involved in vitamin
biosynthesis and xenobiotic degradation, thereby maturing the
gut microbiome (Backhed et al., throughout these developmental processes. HN was supported by Ministry of Science, Technology &
