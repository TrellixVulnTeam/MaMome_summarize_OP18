Pregnancy and the Microbiome

that we are born germ free (Tissier, 1900) and is still the belief
of many physicians, numerous pieces of evidence now cast
doubt on this hypothesis, and suggest that a bacterial presence
already exists in the feto-placental unit (Hu et al., A study in which probiotics were administered to
pregnant women 14 days before C-section revealed modulation
of the infant microbiota, implying an early maternal eﬀect on the
oﬀspring’s microbiota (Rautava et al., It was believed that cases

the emergence of microbiome research and the realization that
changes in the maternal microbiome compositions occur during
pregnancy, it has been suggested that there may be correlations
between the microbial communities present, and the health of the
pregnancy (Mysorekar and Cao, 2014). Alternatively, it was suggested that
hematogenous spread of oral microbes to the placenta might be
a driver of preterm birth (Aagaard et al., Generally, the gut microbiota of vaginally born infants is ﬁrst
colonized by bacteria from the maternal vagina, characterized
by enrichment in the Prevotella, Sneathia, and Lactobacillus
genera, and also includes bacteria present in the maternal
gut (Mackie et al.,
