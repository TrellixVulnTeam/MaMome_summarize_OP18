which has been widely investigated during menopause. Considering that menopause can last

for approximately
30 years of a woman’s life (Brotman et al., 2014), the purpose
of this mini-review is to highlight the importance of alterations
in the oral and gut microbiota during estrogen deﬁciency and
determine their relevance in oral infections and inﬂammatory
diseases that are associated with menopause. However, in the presence
of stressors that can perturb this homeostasis, several oral
infectious diseases may appear,
including dental caries and
periodontitis (Almstahl et al., 2007), such as cardiovascular diseases (Joshipura et al., Fusobacterium,

Vieira et al. Periodontitis is a chronic inﬂammatory process that occurs
in response to an increase in Gram-negative bacteria in the
bioﬁlm (Ruby and Barbeau, 2002), aﬀecting the tissues that
surround and support the teeth. In addition,
changes in periodontal status were found to be associated
with variations in sex hormone levels (Mascarenhas et al., In mice, estrogen seems to modulate IL-1 production
and participate in the resistance of females to disseminating
dentoalveolar infections, leading to the enhanced localization
of these infections (Youssef and Stashenko, 2017), which draws
attention to the potential role of sex-related hormones in the
modulation of oral mucosal infections. THE INTERACTION BETWEEN GUT
MICROBIOTA AND FEMALE SEX
HORMONES

As mentioned earlier, female sex hormones levels inﬂuence
the composition of the microbiota in many sites of the body,
especially the gut. Experimental ﬁndings in mice have shown
that
female sexual
hormones, and immunity are associated with the development
of autoimmune diseases (Yurkovetskiy et al., 2013) and rheumatoid
arthritis (Wu et al., However, host functional
alterations, such as metabolic and immunological changes, also
occur. Obesity aﬀects 65% of postmenopausal women and is
associated with the onset of metabolic dysfunction (Leeners
et al., Microbiota and Female Sex Hormones

levels or the absence of estrogen hormone in the metabolism of
women have not been suﬃciently studied and require further
clariﬁcation. Another link between the gut microbiome and menopausal
health is related to bone. Experimental studies have also demonstrated
similar results. Additionally, sex
steroid deprivation has been reported to promote intestinal
permeability (Figure 1), and the oral administration of
L. rhamnosus GG (LGG) or VSL#3 (a combination of tree
probiotics) to estrogen-deﬁcient mice signiﬁcantly reinforced
intestinal barrier integrity and completely protected the mice
against sex steroid depletion-induced bone loss (Li et al., However, another study compared 48
postmenopausal breast cancer patients and 48 control patients
and observed that postmenopausal women with breast cancer
exhibited an altered composition and estrogen-independent
low diversity of their microbiota (Goedert et al., Some, but not all, studies
have shown a lower risk of breast cancer associated with equol
production (Hullar et al., 2014;
