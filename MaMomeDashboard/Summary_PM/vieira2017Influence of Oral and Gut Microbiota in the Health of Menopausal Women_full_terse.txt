Vieira et al. In mice, estrogen seems to modulate IL-1 production
and participate in the resistance of females to disseminating
dentoalveolar infections, leading to the enhanced localization
of these infections (Youssef and Stashenko, 2017), which draws
attention to the potential role of sex-related hormones in the
modulation of oral mucosal infections. Interestingly, oral inoculation with P. gingivalis
in experimental models leads to a change in the intestinal
microbiota, which is a possible mechanism for the establishment

of diseases associated with periodontitis, such as cardiovascular
diseases (Arimatsu et al., Experimental Ô¨Åndings in mice have shown
that
female sexual
hormones, and immunity are associated with the development
of autoimmune diseases (Yurkovetskiy et al., However, another study compared 48
postmenopausal breast cancer patients and 48 control patients
and observed that postmenopausal women with breast cancer
exhibited an altered composition and estrogen-independent
low diversity of their microbiota (Goedert et al.,
