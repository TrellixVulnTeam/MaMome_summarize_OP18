Feeding mode interacts with other perinatal factors to 
influence the infant gut microbiota. Introduction 
of foods high in protein and fiber increases microbial diver-
sity, but the particular foods most correlated with microbial 
diversity differ depending on whether the infant is still being 
breastfed  For example, a greater number of predicted 
functional changes were identified in FF and MF infants dur-
ing introduction of solids compared to BF infants, suggest-
ing that breastfeeding may increase the plasticity of the infant 
microbiome . Egyptian children had Prevotella enterotype, and Ameri-. Dietary pat-
tern 2, defined by intake of grains, dairy and legumes, nuts 
and seeds, was associated with higher Cyanobacteria and 
Phascolarctobacterium abundance and lower Dorea and 
Eubacterium abundance  Additionally, the intake of . Greater Bifidobacterium abundance in 1- to 4-year-olds 
compared to adults has been reported  and recent stud-
ies have shown that the relative abundance of Bifidobac-
terium in older children is related to dietary intake and is . was negatively correlated with fish and beef 
intake . For example, administration of wheat bran extract (5 g/d 
for 3 weeks) increased fecal Bifidobacterium  while 
consumption of soluble corn fiber (SCF; 10 or 20 g/d for 
4 weeks) modulated the overall microbiota, increased the 
alpha diversity and altered the relative abundances of some 
bacterial genera, including Parabacteroides and unclassi-
fied Lachnospiraceae  This same group also showed 
that GOS increased calcium absorption 
in adolescent girls and boys, demonstrating a health benefit 
for this age population. For example, supplementation of pregnant and
