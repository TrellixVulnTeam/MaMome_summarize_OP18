Lactobacillus crispatus  CTV-05  (Lactin-V,  Osel) 
is  a  live  biotherapeutic  product  that  contains  a 
naturally occurring vaginal strain of L. crispatus. Representatives of the Division of Microbiology 
and  Infectious  Diseases,  National  Institute  of 
Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National 
Institutes  of  Health  (NIH)  reviewed  the  proto-
col. Copyright © 2020 Massachusetts Medical Society. After 
providing written informed consent to partici-
pate in the trial, eligible women were randomly 
assigned,  in  a  2:1  ratio,  to  receive  Lactin-V  at 
2×109  CFU  per  dose  or  matching  placebo  and 
subsequently  received  a  carton  containing  25 
vaginal applicators. The placebo formulation con-
tained the same inactive ingredients as Lactin-V, 
without L. crispatus CTV-05. The  ran-
domization sequence was prepared by statisti-
cians at Emmes. The 
data from the questionnaire are not reported here.) The severity of all ad-
verse  events  was  graded  according  to  grading 
tables  provided  by  the  Division  of  AIDS  of  the

The New England Journal of Medicine Downloaded from nejm.org at UPPSALA UNIVERSITY on May 13, 2020. Post 
hoc  sensitivity  analyses  for  missing  data  were 
performed  to  calculate  risk  ratios  and  corre-
sponding  confidence  intervals;  the  hypothesis 
tests  were  performed  with  the  use  of  logistic-

regression  multiple  imputation,  under  the  as-
sumption  of  a  monotone  pattern  of  missing 
data.23,24 The results of the prespecified inten-
tion-to-treat  analyses  in  which  missing  data 
were  imputed  with  the  use  of  the  last-observa-
tion-carried-forward  method  were  included  in 
the final clinical trial report and were reported 
to ClinicalTrials.gov. In  addition,  the  associations  of 
adherence  to  the  assigned  treatment  (≥75%  of 
doses administered vs. <75% of doses adminis-
tered), reported occurrence of menses since the 
last  visit  (menses  vs.  no  menses),  and  reported 
occurrence of sexual activity (sex without the use 
of a condom vs. abstinence or sex with the use of 
a condom) with the presence of L. crispatus spe-
cies and L. crispatus CTV-05 were assessed as ex-
ploratory analyses, as specified in the statistical 
analysis plan. The  widths  of  the  confidence  inter-
vals  were  not  adjusted  for  multiplicity,  so  the 
intervals should not be used to infer definitive 
treatment  effects  for  the  secondary  or  other 
outcomes. Lactin-V to Prevent Recurrence of Bacterial Vaginosis

Among  the  participants  without  known  recur-
rence of bacterial vaginosis by week 12, a total 
of 13 of 106 participants in the Lactin-V 
group and 7 of 42 participants in the pla-
cebo  group  had  a  recurrence  by  week  24. The incidence and risk ratio for each vari-
able are provided in Table S3. Across  the  two  treatment  groups,  the  most 
common solicited local adverse events were ab-
normal vaginal discharge, abnormal vaginal odor, 
external  genital  irritation,  and  genital  itching 
,  and  the  most  common  solicited  sys-
temic  adverse  events  were  abdominal  pain  or 
cramps,  headache,  and  frequent  urination. The size of each 
blue bar represents the interquartile range. Overall,  adherence  to  the  assigned 
treatment  was  high. T h e  n e w   e ng l a n d   j o u r na l   o f  m e dic i n e

since the last visit or the occurrence of sex with-
out the use of a condom affected the detection 
of L. crispatus CTV-05. A data sharing statement provided by the authors is available
