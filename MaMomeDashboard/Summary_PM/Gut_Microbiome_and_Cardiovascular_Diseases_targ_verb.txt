The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, an indicator of dysbiosis, increased in the CAD patients
compared with the non-CAD controls. Last year, a metagenome-wide association
study of fecal samples from 218 CAD patients and 187 healthy subjects from China was reported 
The abundance of Enterobacteriaceae was signiﬁcantly higher in the CAD patients compared to the
healthy subjects. was also signiﬁcantly higher in the patients
with CAD than in the healthy subjects. This may be due to the use of proton pump inhibitors in
CAD patients  Consistent with our results, Bacteroides spp. are known to have an important role in maintaining a
healthy gut ecosystem  and that the abundance of Bacteroides spp. was found to decrease in
patients with atherosclerotic ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack  Bacteroides spp. may
have the potential to regulate atherosclerosis progression. Of note, the co-abundance network structure differed between the two groups. On the other hand, the positive correlation between Bacteroides spp. and Erysipelotrichaceae bacterium
was seen only in the healthy subjects. These results implied that a peculiar inter-species relationship in
the gut microbiome may exist in CAD patients compared to healthy subjects..

Additionally, there are some studies that have demonstrated the relationship between the
gut microbiome and heart failure (HF). Ruminococcus, Acinetobacter, and Veillonella increased in the HF patients,
whereas Alistipes, Faecalibacterium, and Oscillibacter decreased. In line with the previous report,
Faecalibacterium prausnitzii decreased in the HF patients compared to the controls. and Enterobacter aerogenes),
