Several studies have demonstrated modulation of colonic 
microbiota by prebiotic inulin or inulin-type fructans. and 
F. prausnitzii in obese women  In healthy adults with 
mild constipation, inulin-type fructans increased the relative 
abundance of Anaerostipes, Bilophila and Bifidobacterium 
in feces, and reduced the abundance of Bilophila  Dif-
ferences in selectivity for the fermentation of several car-
bohydrate substrates (lactulose, galacto-oligosaccharides, 
sugar beet pectin and apple fiber) were found between the . Additional described effects of prebiotics include reduc-
ing  toxins  produced  from  protein  metabolism  in  urine 
(p-cresol and ammonia) and serum (p-cresyl sulphate) 
 and increasing calcium absorption in adolescents [30, 
31]. Prebiotics may also exert beneficial effects on host 
physiology which are independent of the microbiota as dem-
onstrated by in vitro experiments for GOS. This adverse 
effect of PPIs on bacterial diversity was greater than for any 
other drug class, including antibiotics. Fiber-degrading bacteria include Ruminococcus 
callidus, Ruminococcus albus, Blautia obeum and Prevo-
tella spp. The bar represents 10 µm (Photo, M. Sadaghian Sadabad). Further studies on the role of the maternal 
microbiome in development of the neonatal microbiome are 
necessary..

Preclinical studies have shown effects of the gut micro-
biota on nociceptive reflexes  feeding, emotional and 
social behavior  and brain neu-
rochemistry  The gut microbiota is essential for 
normal social development in the mouse and is implicated 
in neurodevelopmental disorders including autism spectrum 
disorder  Germfree mice have an exaggerated 
stress response compared with control animals. produced significant changes in brain activity assessed by 
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in response 
to an emotional faces attention task. plus Bifidobacterium bifidum signifi-
cantly improved the mini-mental state examination scores, 
and produced significant changes in a range of metabolic 
parameters including plasma malondialdehyde, serum hs-
CRP and serum triglycerides  Consumption of the 
prebiotic B-GOS, but not the prebiotic FOS, by healthy vol-
unteers significantly reduced the salivary cortisol awakening 
response when compared to placebo .
