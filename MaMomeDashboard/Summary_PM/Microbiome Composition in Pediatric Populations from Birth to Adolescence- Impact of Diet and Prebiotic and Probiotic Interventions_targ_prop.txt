thesis than FF  although another study reported similar 
data related to fatty acid biosynthesis genes, but opposite 
results for carbohydrate and lipid metabolism  Com-
pared to FF infants, the BF infant’s microbiome has more 
genes associated with vitamin and cofactor metabolism 
 and glutathione metabo-
lism  Discrepancies among the studies could be due to 
differences in infant age or the inclusion of mixed-feeding 
infants (MF) in different feeding groups. Introduction 
of foods high in protein and fiber increases microbial diver-
sity, but the particular foods most correlated with microbial 
diversity differ depending on whether the infant is still being 
breastfed  For example, a greater number of predicted 
functional changes were identified in FF and MF infants dur-
ing introduction of solids compared to BF infants, suggest-
ing that breastfeeding may increase the plasticity of the infant
