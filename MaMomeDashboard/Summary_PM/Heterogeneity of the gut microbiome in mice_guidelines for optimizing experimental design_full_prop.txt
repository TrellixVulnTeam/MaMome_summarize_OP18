FEMS Microbiology Reviews, 2016, Vol. For ethical and practical reasons, it may
not always be feasible to collect tissue (biopsy) samples. It seems advisable to include
a standard level of analysis methods, looking systematically for
differences between a pre-defined set of taxonomic units, e.g.
phylum, genus and species level. Mice harboring
human microbiota had low levels of mucosal CD4+ and CD8+
T cells, few dendritic cells and reduced antimicrobial peptide
expression. Importantly, mice with mouse mi-
crobiota conferred better protection against Salmonella infection
than those with human microbiota. Antibiotic treatment

Antibiotics can be used to demonstrate that the mere presence
of bacteria contributes to a specific phenotype (Ochoa-Rep ´araz
et al. Right after birth, pups can be fostered by an-
other mother and when mice are older, bacteria can be trans-
ferred by gavage, intrarectal administration or by simply cohous-
ing the animals. Artificial colonization of GF mice with specific pathogen-free
(SPF) flora partly reversed the response to restraint stress (de-
fined by an increase of plasma cortisol levels) when the flora
was introduced at 6 weeks of age but not at 14 weeks of age
(Sudo et al. 2012), in accordance with the successful treatment
of human relapsing C. difficile colitis. Later in life, im-
munity is far less susceptible to change by microbial influence,
probably due to increased stability of microbiome homeostasis. Of high importance in orchestrating
intestinal barrier function and innate sensing are ILCs, which
are the resident immune cell regulators at epithelial surfaces
that share many of the CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell functions (Son-
nenberg and Artis 2012). Still, even gene deletions that cause a remark-
able phenotypic abnormality, such as the Ob/Ob mouse, have
been shown to have a much weaker effect than a change in diet
on the microbial composition (Hildebrandt et al. The presence of segmented
filamentous bacteria in the gut of mice of Taconic caused a
higher frequency of Th17 cells compared with mice from Jack-
son Laboratory who lacked these bacteria (Ivanov et al. This type of variation is not
restricted to commercially available strains but also plays a role
when comparing studies performed in different animal labora-

tory sources (Ubeda et al. One might expect that the development of spontaneous dis-
eases in transgenic or knockout mice will depend on whether
they are housed in an SPF or in a conventional environment. Cage effects in conventionally housed mice are dramatic. Diet

Diet is one of the most important environmental factors influ-
encing microbiome composition. 125

in the animal facility might induce unwanted stress responses. Other
stressors include the presence of other animals and population
density. However, cohousing of mice with dif-
ferent genotypes (e.g. wild type and knockout) has been shown
to change the gut microbial composition, affecting their natu-
ral immunological responses to a treatment or a disease trigger
(Garrett et al. In case the effect is more subtle,
it is recommended to separate littermate controls according to
their genotype right after weaning for at least 30 days before
the experiment so that the mice can develop their inherent mi-
crobiota; however, they should be divided over several cages. Collections of standardized microbiota

Establishing a collection of different standardized microbiotas
in isobiotic mice to be shared between institutions for repro-
ducible experimentation has been proposed (Hooper, Littman
and Macpherson 2012). Increasing evidence sug-
gests that the microbial environment influences the innate
and adaptive immune system and largely determines the out-
come of such investigations, even in disease models where the
microbiome is not under investigation. G.0787.13; G0C3114], a
