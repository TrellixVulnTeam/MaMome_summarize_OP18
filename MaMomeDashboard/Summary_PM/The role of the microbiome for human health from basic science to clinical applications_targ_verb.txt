Several studies have demonstrated modulation of colonic 
microbiota by prebiotic inulin or inulin-type fructans. Real-
time  polymerase  chain  reaction  (PCR)  identification  of 
selected bacterial species in the feces of human volunteers 
after inulin ingestion showed that the prevalence of Fae-
calibacterium prausnitzii and two Bifidobacterium species, 
B. adolescentis and B. bifidum, increased significantly  
In a placebo-controlled study, dietary inulin-type fructans 
increased the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium spp. Clostridium XIVa
E. halli R. hominis
Anaerostipes . Additional described effects of prebiotics include reduc-
ing  toxins  produced  from  protein  metabolism  in  urine 
(p-cresol and ammonia) and serum (p-cresyl sulphate) 
 and increasing calcium absorption in adolescents [30, 
31]. Prebiotics may also exert beneficial effects on host 
physiology which are independent of the microbiota as dem-
onstrated by in vitro experiments for GOS. The effects of butyrate on the human colonic mucosa 
were examined following administration of butyrate enemas 
at physiologically relevant concentrations in healthy volun-
teers. This adverse 
effect of PPIs on bacterial diversity was greater than for any 
other drug class, including antibiotics. Given the profound effect of PPIs on the gut microbiome 
and the fact that over 11% of population in The Netherlands 
and other European countries are using PPIs on prescription 
(not including over the counter use of PPIs) implies a major 
PPI-dependent influence on the gut microbiome taxonomy 
and function on a populational scale..

The human gut microbiota contains bacteria that are ben-
eficial to the host, and bacteria with pathogenic potential, 
termed ‘pathobionts’  An important role of beneficial 
bacteria is the metabolic production of SCFAs by cross-feed-
ing . Fiber-degrading bacteria include Ruminococcus 
callidus, Ruminococcus albus, Blautia obeum and Prevo-
tella spp. The bar represents 10 µm (Photo, M. Sadaghian Sadabad). Preterm infants show delayed colonization of the gut 
microbiota with Bifidobacterium, and have a high preva-
lence of Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus, and Enterococ-
caceae  Vaginally delivered neonates have an increased 
prevalence of maternal microbiota derived from the vagina 
and intestine (e.g. Lactobacillus, Prevotella and Sneathia) 
compared with neonates delivered by Caesarean section. Therefore, the maternal microbiome 
also seems to be important for the development of the neo-
natal microbiome. These mice 
also exhibit increased motor activity and lower anxiety-like 
behavior compared with control mice  Administra-
tion of the probiotic L. rhamnosus (JB-1) to mice reduced . lactis, 
Streptococcus thermophiles, and two Lactobacillus spp. produced significant changes in brain activity assessed by 
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in response 
to an emotional faces attention task. plus Bifidobacterium bifidum produced a significant 
decrease in Beck Depression Inventory total scores, sig-
nificant decreases in serum insulin levels and serum high-
sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) concentrations in 
addition to a significant increase in plasma total glutathione 
concentrations  A RCT of patients with Alzheimer’s 
disease found that ingestion of a probiotic containing three
