the dysbiosis of host gut microbiota and modulating of gut microbiota may be beneficial for
PCOS treatment. In this experiment, 32 female SD rats were randomly assigned into 4
groups of 8 rats each, including a control group that received a gavage of normal saline, and
three treatment groups (PCOS, PCOS FMT and PCOS Lactobacillus transplantation groups)
administered a gavage of letrozole (Novartis Pharma Schweiz AG, Switzerland) at a concentra-
tion of 1 mg/kg once daily for 21 consecutive days. There were no significant differences in the copy number of
Bifidobacterium, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus and Bacteroides in the two groups (Table 2)..

In order to verify the effects of FMT and Lactobacillus transplantation on the composition
of gut microbiota in PCOS rats, PCOS rats were treated with FMT or Lactobacillus and the bac-
teria described above were examined. Lactobacillus treatment group
(MeanÂ±sem). When PCOS rats were treated with FMT or Lactobacillus,
the testosterone and androstenedione levels were decreased significantly compared with those
in PCOS rats (Fig 5C and 5D). D) PCOS FMT group
showed increased granulosa layers and formation of corpora lutea.
