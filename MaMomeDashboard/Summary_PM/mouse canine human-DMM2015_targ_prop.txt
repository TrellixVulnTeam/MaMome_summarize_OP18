Presence of haustrum and taenia coli in the colon . (E) Cross-section of a human colon, which has a thicker muscular wall and
mucosa compared with the mouse colon (D). For instance, Prevotella abundance
is  known  to  be  low  in  mouse  gut  microbiota  (Hildebrand  et  al., 2013), in which low species-richness individuals
were  found  to  have  more  pronounced  inflammation,  and  to  be
dominated by Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, the same bacterial
groups that dominated the ‘inflamed’ mouse enterotype..

Obesity
The influence of diet on the gut microbiota has received increasing
research attention over recent years. Overall,  this
highlights  that  the  use  of  diet  intervention  in  murine  models,
including the use of humanized gnotobiotic mice, can mimic the
changes in gut microbiota that occur in relation to human diet..

Bacteroides enterotype, which is associated with animal protein, and
Prevotella enterotype, which links to diets with more carbohydrates
and simple sugars. Interestingly, mucosal expression
levels  of  A20  in  humans  have  been  put  forward  as  a  prognosis
marker  for  response  to  anti-TNF  treatment  in  IBD  patients
