Presence of haustrum and taenia coli in the colon . Overall,  this
highlights  that  the  use  of  diet  intervention  in  murine  models,
including the use of humanized gnotobiotic mice, can mimic the
changes in gut microbiota that occur in relation to human diet..

Bacteroides enterotype, which is associated with animal protein, and
Prevotella enterotype, which links to diets with more carbohydrates
and simple sugars. Mouse studies have also detected changes in abundance of bacterial
phylotypes that solely happen in mice, such as of Tenericutes and
Deferribacteriaceae (Nagalingam et al., Interestingly, mucosal expression
levels  of  A20  in  humans  have  been  put  forward  as  a  prognosis
marker  for  response  to  anti-TNF  treatment  in  IBD  patients
(Vereecke et al., 2012)..

most of the models show inflammation/lesions in the large, instead of
the small, intestine, which more closely resembles ulcerative colitis
symptoms (Peloquin and Nguyen, 2013). Because a healthy commensal
intestinal microbiota affects the potential for infection by a pathogen
(pathogen exclusion), the gut microbiota of guinea pigs has been
investigated in several studies (Hildebrand et al.,
