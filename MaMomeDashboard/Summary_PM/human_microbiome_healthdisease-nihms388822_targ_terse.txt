Among all mammals, the microbiota is extensively conserved at high taxonomic levels7, but
variation increases at progressively lower taxonomic levels30. Indicator organisms such as Helicobacter pylori32 and
reptococcus mutans33 highlight some differences across the microbiota34 and
S
t
metagenome35 among human ethnic groups; however, the extent of ethnic variation in
overall metagenomic composition is unknown. Lactobacilli
represent the pioneer community in mice55 as well as humans39, preparing the
gastrointestinal tract for subsequent microbial successions, until microbial maturity is
reached..

The multiple opportunities for the microbiota to be transferred from a mother to her baby
may be disrupted by modern lifestyles. Classic atopic dermatitis occurs in areas, such as the ANTECUBITAL and POPLITEAL FOSSAE,
with similar microbial populations89, suggesting a microbiome role. Such shifts may
interact with aberrantly expressed host cutaneous defense response genes92, thereby
increasing disease risk..

The discovery that H. pylori was adapted to survive in the acidic gastric environment
overturned the dogma that the stomach is sterile. The enrichment of Fusobacterium species (not
limited to F. nucleatum) was confirmed when evaluating the mucosal microbiome of
colorectal cancers compared to adjacent normal tissues from 99 subjects101.
