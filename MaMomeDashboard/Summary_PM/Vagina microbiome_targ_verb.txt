proﬁle identiﬁed based on sequencing different
variable regions. Furthermore, the number of Lactobacil-
lus species detected (and thus relative abun-
dance) will vary depending on the 16S region
sequenced, with V1V3 revealing more unique
Lactobacillus operational
taxonomic units
(OTUs) as compared with V3V5 (Huse et al. A) The 16S rDNA gene of bacteria
contains nine hypervariable regions (V1–V9) that are ﬂanked by conserved regions, which makes this gene an
ideal target for PCR ampliﬁcation and bacterial classiﬁcation. The dotted line indicates the direction of ampliﬁcation. ( Five distinct community state types (CSTs) were
revealed, and the majority of these CSTs were
dominated by species of lactobacilli. However, re-
cent studies have shown the caution that must
be used when performing analysis such as CSTs
(Koren et al. Additionally, the vag-
inal mucosa increases in thickness and cervical
secretions increase, which causes the underlying
smooth muscle cells to hypertrophy and relax
the connective tissue. The utilization of Next-Gen sequencing tech-
niques to study the vaginal microbiome further
showed the presence of Lactobacillus species in
the vagina during pregnancy. Vaginal samples collected
from a cross-sectional survey of gravid subjects
from 18 wk gestation to term or delivery, and
all samples were collected by a single physician
who also conducted the HMP sampling for
50% of subjects. However, direct asso-
ciations between speciﬁc species of Lactobacillus
and estrogen levels are lacking and warrant fur-
ther investigation..

However, the aforementioned studies were
cross-sectional, which allows for the character-
ization of a pregnancy and gestational age-com-
mon microbiome signature, but lacks capacity
for description of the dynamic changes, which
may occur in an individual over time. Interestingly, only
16.9% of gravidae that had a lactobacilli-dom-
inant vaginal microbiome in the ﬁrst trimester
decreased the prevalence of lactobacilli during
pregnancy. When the
stability of the vaginal microbiome was exam-
ined during pregnancy, the authors noted that
the vaginal microbiome of gravid subjects shift-
ed between CSTs dominated by lactobacilli but
rarely shifted to CST IV, which is marked by a
diminished abundance of Lactobacillus species
(Romero et al. Similar ﬁndings
were found in an independent study by Romero
et al. However, a sepa-
rate study by this group also determined that
bacterial enzymes were not altered in the stool
of infants based on mode of delivery (Gro¨nlund
et al. in which the
intestinal microbiome of an infant was moni-
tored for 2.5 yr. Our ﬁnding of Fuso-
bacteria to be a relatively abundant taxon in the
placenta supports the hypothesis of hematoge-
nous spread from the oral cavity to the placenta
