the commonality that relates both BV and vaginal pH to HPV
infection (independent of HIV) is the RA of certain Lactobacil-
lus species, most notably L. crispatus. Hierarchical clustering found 6 CSTs, with 5 dominated by
an individual Lactobacillus species, whereas CST IV-B com-
prised a variety of genera (eg, Prevotella, Atopobium, Mega-
sphaera, and Sneathia) with a low RA of Lactobacillus species. While CST I (L. crispatus dominated)
had an inverse association with detection of any HPV and espe-
cially with any oncogenic HPV, the relationship was of border-
line statistical signiﬁcance (eg, odds ratio [OR] for oncogenic
HPV was 0.30 [95% conﬁdence interval {CI},
.08–1.11];
P = .07). D-lactic acid (but not L-lactic acid) levels have been
inversely associated with the ability of HIV to transverse cervi-
covaginal mucous  An antiviral effect of D-lactic acid would
be consistent with our results for oncogenic HPV, since L. crisp-
atus produces D and L isoforms of lactic acid, whereas L. iners. Nor
did we have sufﬁcient data to assess statistical interaction (eg,
by immune strata), and it may require subanalyses among sex-
ually inactive women to help differentiate reactivation of previ-
ously acquired from newly acquired (incident) HPV. The study
also focused on only premenopausal African American women,
which was done to reduce the number of factors being studied..

In summary, our results suggest a beneﬁcial effect of L. crisp-
atus on the burden of HPV in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected
women that is unrelated to pH. Further research to better un-
derstand these relationships is strongly warranted, including
large prospective cohort studies and laboratory research to un-
derstand the mechanisms that underlie the relation of the cer-
vicovaginal microbiota with HPV infection.
