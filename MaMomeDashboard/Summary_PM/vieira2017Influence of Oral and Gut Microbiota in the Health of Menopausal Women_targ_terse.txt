Estrogen receptor-beta has been detected in the oral mucosa
and salivary glands (Valimaa et al., 2004), and some evidence
shows age-related hormonal changes in the exfoliated normal
buccal mucosa of women (Donald et al., 2009), an understanding of the impact of female sex. Approximately
one in two women over age 50 will break a bone because of
osteoporosis. Experimental studies have also demonstrated
similar results. Additionally, sex
steroid deprivation has been reported to promote intestinal
permeability (Figure 1), and the oral administration of
L. rhamnosus GG (LGG) or VSL#3 (a combination of tree
probiotics) to estrogen-deﬁcient mice signiﬁcantly reinforced
intestinal barrier integrity and completely protected the mice
against sex steroid depletion-induced bone loss (Li et al.,
