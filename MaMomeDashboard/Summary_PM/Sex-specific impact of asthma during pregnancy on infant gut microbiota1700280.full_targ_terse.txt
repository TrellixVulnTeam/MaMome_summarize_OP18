Female infants are generally born smaller than male infants; however, in response to maternal asthma, the
Caucasian male fetus is more likely to have a lower birthweight and show growth retardation when
delivered at term than the female fetus recently reported less colonisation of stool
with Lactobacillus species at birth and during the first month of life among full-term male infants in
comparison to female infants. Data are presented as n (%),unless otherwise stated. Comparisons were performed
using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. The p-values <0.1 are reported and
p-values <0.05 are indicated in bold. Â¶: Differences were
also evident at the Bacteroidaceae family level ( p=0.02, supplementary table S2) in all female breastfed
infants born vaginally without
the
Firmicutes phylum ( p<0.05)..

Lactobacilli were less abundant in male infants born to women with asthma and concomitant food or
environmental allergies, or asthma and pre-pregnancy overweight; statistical significance was not observed in
the absence of either comorbidity (table 4). Further,
amniotic fluid are capable of modulating expression of toll-like receptor genes in the fetal gut  In our
study, the reduction in Lactobacillus abundance was most apparent among infants whose mothers had
asthma and overweight or a history of allergies.
