Using the RDP 9 alignment  we extracted segments cor-
responding to 100-base regions of the Escherichia coli refer-
ence sequence J01695 at 25-base intervals and used each re-
gion independently for exhaustive leave-one-out
testing,
removing the corresponding full-length sequence from training
for each test. These misclassiﬁcations are
not evenly distributed among the taxa. Of the three most rep-
resented phyla (Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria),
the Actinobacteria had the fewest errors (3%, or 31 in 1,220
trials), while the misclassiﬁcation rate for the Firmicutes was
about ﬁve times as high  Within
the Firmicutes, more than two-thirds of the errors occurred in
the class Clostridia  and within that class, the
genus Eubacterium stood out, with 30 misclassiﬁcations in 41
trials (see the supplemental material)..

FIG. In 2005, S.
thermosulﬁdooxidans strain K1 was reclassiﬁed as the type strain of a
new species, A. tolerans  In our analysis, however, the sequence for
K1 given in the naming paper (accession number AF137502) is 8%
different from that for Z21979.
