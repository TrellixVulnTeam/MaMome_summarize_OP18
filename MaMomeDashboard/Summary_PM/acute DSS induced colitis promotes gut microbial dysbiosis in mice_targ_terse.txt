The aim of the present study was to utilize Illumina
sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and inferred meta-
genomics by open source software PICRUSt (Phyloge-
netic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of
Unobserved States  to investigate differences in
microbiome composition and function in the fecal and
colonic mucosa of mice treated with 5% DSS for 5 days. Alpha- and beta-diversity analyses
Within community diversity (a-diversity) was calculated
by different indices of species richness and evenness
such as Observed Number of Species, Chao1, ACE
(abundance-based coverage estimators), Shannon, Simp-
son, InvSimpson, and Fisher using the open source R
software. DSS, dextran sulphate sodium..

Of the 86 taxa, 56 had abundance greater than or equal
to 0.01% of community, whereas 30 were below 0.01%. 5b, Lactobacillus reuteri, Bacteroides ovatus; g. rc4-4,
Rikenellaceae, Biﬁdobacterium, YS2, Clostridium; f. Bacter-
oidaceae, Clostridiaceae; o. RF32, RF39, Bacteroidales,
Clostridales; and p. Proteobacteria were positively. In this regard, it
was worth noting that more taxa were signiﬁcantly
associated with the DSS treatment in fecal samples
compared to the colonic samples; however, several
taxa including: Bacteroides ovatus, g. Clostridium, rc4-4;
f. Clostridiaceae, Bacteroidaceae; and o. Bacteroidales,
RF39, and RF32 were positively associated with the DSS
treatment in both fecal and colonic mucosa samples. Given that the microbial analysis of diversity, commu-
nity composition and also changes at phylum level for
colonic samples did not show any signiﬁcant difference
between the DSS and control mice, the results suggest
that analysis at microbial functional level might reveal
important colitis-related changes in gut microbiome
that are otherwise not noticeable at higher phylogenetic
or community levels.
