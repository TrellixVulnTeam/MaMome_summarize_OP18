Following screening, participants were admitted and placed on a WMD. Taken together, these 
results support our hypothesis that both UF and vancomycin result 
in greater stool calorie loss relative to ingested calories (greater per-
centage  of  calories  measured  in  stool),  indicating  a  reduction  in 
nutrient absorption in both states. Despite 
these differences, we were able to identify two bacterial species that 
consistently changed in response to both perturbations  based 
on  16S  rRNA  sequence  variants  analysis:  A.  muciniphila,  a  mucin-
degrading  bacterium  with  a  putative  role  in  preserving  gut  barrier

cin group, and an unidentified species belonging to Lachnospiraceae 
NK4A136 group, which decreased during UF and vancomycin inter-
ventions. Discussion
In  this  two-phase  study  we  directly  measured  ingested  and  stool 
calories, demonstrating an increased and comparable stool calorie 
loss relative to ingested calories during two states: UF versus OF and 
oral vancomycin versus placebo. Each data point shows the mean and standard deviation of samples from each 
subject (n = 70 samples from 24 subjects; P < 0.0001, determined using Adonis comparing effect of treatment and accounting for repeated measures 
per subject). The  difference  in  actual  calories  of  ~80 kcal d−1 
appears to be comparable to the difference in stool calories between 
placebo and vancomycin groups in the study by Reijnders et al.17.
