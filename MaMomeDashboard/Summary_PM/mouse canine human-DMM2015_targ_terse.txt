Presence of haustrum and taenia coli in the colon . This result is consistent with what has been recently
found  in  studies  of  human  obesity  (Cotillard  et  al., Overall,  this
highlights  that  the  use  of  diet  intervention  in  murine  models,
including the use of humanized gnotobiotic mice, can mimic the
changes in gut microbiota that occur in relation to human diet..

Bacteroides enterotype, which is associated with animal protein, and
Prevotella enterotype, which links to diets with more carbohydrates
and simple sugars. Mouse studies have also detected changes in abundance of bacterial
phylotypes that solely happen in mice, such as of Tenericutes and
Deferribacteriaceae (Nagalingam et al., 2012)..

most of the models show inflammation/lesions in the large, instead of
the small, intestine, which more closely resembles ulcerative colitis
symptoms (Peloquin and Nguyen, 2013). More  recently,  another  study  employed  metagenomic
approaches to compare the gut microbiota composition of humans
and guinea pigs (Hildebrand et al.,
