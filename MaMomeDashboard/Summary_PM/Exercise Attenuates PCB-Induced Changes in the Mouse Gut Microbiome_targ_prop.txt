Tenericutes, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes. Pseudomonas putida strain SRI156
Streptococcus infantis. reported that Erysipelotrichaceae 
were enriched in obese humans and mice, as

that  the  abundance  of  Erysipelotrichaceae 
was  also  increased  in  patients  with  colo­

because we observed a decrease in the num­ 
ber of Erysipelotrichaceae in exercised mice 
that had lost a substantial amount of body

Erysipelotrichaceae in energy production and 
adiposity (Claus et al.
