Gut Microbiome in Human Health

INTRODUCTION

The human microbiome comprises of collective genomes of
microbiota inhabiting us, namely protozoa, archaea, eukaryotes,
viruses and predominantly bacteria that live symbiotically on and
within various sites of the human body. Examples of occupied
habitats include our oral cavity, genital organs, respiratory tract,
skin and gastrointestinal system (Lloyd-Price et al., The diverse gastrointestinal microbiota is predominantly
composed of bacteria from three major phyla, namely Firmicutes,
Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria (Tap et al., Until recent decades, the
properties of the human microbiome and the host–microbiota
interactions have been largely unknown due to technology
limitations especially in examining non-cultivable microbes
of interest, and lack of population-scale data depicting the
microbiota compositions and functions. Robust experimental modeling enables
systematic manipulation of variables to investigate hypotheses
deduced from “omics” studies. For this, the application of
‘humanized’ gnotobiotic animal model that harbors deﬁned
collection of sequenced microbial communities, has gained
momentum in recent years in microbiome research (Faith
et al., This allows proof-of-mechanism study to examine
the potential

host genotypic variation (Ley et al., impacts of diet

Human fecal
sample analysis using 16S ribosomal RNA
and metagenomic sequencing techniques reveal signiﬁcant
enrichment in metabolism of polysaccharides, amino acids,
xenobiotics and micronutrients conferred by gut microbiota,
suggest that these indigenous microbes facilitate host energy
harvesting and metabolic eﬃciency (Gill et al., SCFA (such as butyrate, propionate, acetate and pentanoate) act
as one of the energy substrates for the host (Salminen et al., Microbial-synthesized SCFAs contribute 70% of
ATP production in colon, with butyrate as the preferred fuel
for colonocytes (Firmansyah et al., Butyrate-producing microbes rescued the deﬁcit mitochondrial
respiration, ATP synthesis and autophagy in colonocytes of germ-
free mice (Donohoe et al., Both primary and secondary bile acids
are able to activate host nuclear FXR signaling, which in turn
regulates the bile acids production, glucose metabolism, and
potentially hepatic autophagy (Lee et al., Such antimicrobial
