Morowitz et al. Mechanistic studies in gnotobiotic animals further demonstrated that, when B.
thetaiotaomicron senses a scarcity of fucose in the intestinal lumen, it actually induces the
gut epithelium to upregulate expression of fucosylated glycans that can be used by the
bacteria as an energy source without harming the host  This body of work illustrates
how the remarkable host-microbe symbiosis can be teased apart by pairing genomic
sequencing efforts with creative in vivo laboratory studies. In fact, several specialized epithelial
transporters have been recognized to participate specifically in the absorption of vitamins
derived from gut bacteria  Perhaps the relative ease in replenishing vitamin stores in
ICU patients has minimized enthusiasm for aggressive investigation of how bacterial
vitamin biosynthesis is altered in hospitalized patients. Recent work
has suggested that the microbiota of obese individuals has an increased capacity to harvest
energy from the diet  Landmark papers, utilizing high-throughput metagenomic
sequencing platforms to identify as many genes as possible from all members of a mixed
population of bacteria, from Gordon, Turnbaugh, Ley and colleagues, have conclusively
demonstrated that the metabolic potential of the gut microbiome varies according to the
