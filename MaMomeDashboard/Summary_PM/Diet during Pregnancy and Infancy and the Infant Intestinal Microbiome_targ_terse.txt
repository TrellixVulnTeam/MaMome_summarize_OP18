In unadjusted analyses of 4 genera selected a priori based
on prior literature suggesting associations with early diet and
health outcomes,7-10,22-25 we found that high maternal intake
of vegetables and low intake of processed meats and deep fried
foods was inversely associated with Bacteroides spp (decrease. Mean, SD for normally distributed variables (Shannon index, Richness). Conversely, Lactobacillus spp counts tended to be
higher among breastfed African American infants compared
with breastfed Hispanic and White infants (African Ameri-
can mean difference = 6.34 log counts, Hispanic mean
difference = 2.53, White mean difference 3.08; Table V and
Figure 2)..

When maternal education was added as a covariate,
the strengths of interactions between breastfeeding vs
formula feeding status and race/ethnicity were weakened
(Biﬁdobacterium spp P = .12; Lactobacillus spp P = .21). Excluding race/ethnicity
from the model, the interaction between breastfeeding status
and maternal education was not signiﬁcant for either
Biﬁdobacterium spp (P = .45) or Lactobacillus spp (P = .73),
further supporting stronger associations of microbial differ-
ences by infant diet group with race/ethnicity than maternal
education..

We identiﬁed signiﬁcant differences in relative abun-
dances of taxa between breastfed and formula- fed infants in
adjusted analyses stratiﬁed by race/ethnicity (Figure 3 and
Table VI; available at www.jpeds.com). There were interactions between race/ethnicity and breastfeeding
vs formula on relative abundances of Biﬁdobacterium and Lactobacillus (P ≤ .10) in negative binomial regression analyses..

is thought to increase Biﬁdobacterium spp.
