Gut microbiota are composed of several species of microorganisms, including bacteria, yeast,
and viruses. 24,
29]. Escherichia, Shigella, and Bacteroides species are underrepresented in infants born by cesarean
delivery  The intestinal microbiota of neonates delivered by cesarean delivery are less diverse in
terms of bacteria species than the microbiota of vaginally delivered infants . Results showed that AN intestinal microbiota
showed a signiﬁcant increase in Enterobacteriaceae and Methanobrevibacter smithii compared with healthy
controls  On the contrary, the genera Roseburia, Ruminococcus, and Clostridium were depleted in
line with the observed reduction in AN of the total SCFAs . Biﬁdobacterium longum, Clostridium
histolyticum, C. lituseburense, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii group proportions are less abundant in
untreated CD patients than in healthy controls. Colorectal cancer is the third most common cause of cancer mortality in the world 
Structural fecal bacterial segregations between CRC patients and healthy volunteers have been
demonstrated  The gut microbiota of the CRC patients were enriched in Bacteroides fragilis,
Enterococcus, Escherichia/Shigella, Klebsiella, Streptococcus, and Peptostreptococcus and were impoverished
in Roseburia and other butyrate-producing bacteria of the family Lachnospiraceae  The gut microbiota
of the healthy volunteers were enriched in Bacteroides vulgatus and Bacteroides uniformis. These ﬁndings demonstrated that
gut microbiota dysbiosis has close relationships with gastrointestinal and behavioral manifestations
of autism..

The bidirectional interactions of gut–brain mean that the brain can also alter gut microbiota
composition demonstrated that exposure
to stress results in substantial changes in gut microbiota composition: a decrease in Bacteroides spp.
