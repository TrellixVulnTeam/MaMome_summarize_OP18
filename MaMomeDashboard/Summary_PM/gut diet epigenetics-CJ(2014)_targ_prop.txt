The fluxes through these pools vary by fiber source and microbial pathways dictated by 
microbial community composition of the lumen. showed 
that while F. prausnitizii and Roseburia spp derived about 85% of butyrate carbon from 
external pools of acetate, Coporcoccus spp. After formation of pyruvate, depending upon the microbial composition, 
propionate is formed via the succinate or the more minor acrylate pathways from 
carbohydrates that reach the colon.42 While butyrate supplies the majority of energy to 
colonic epithelial cells primarily through beta-oxidation, concentrations of SCFA in the 
colon are also high enough to influence regulation of colon epithelial gene expression.43-45. Cooking cruciferous vegetables deactivates the plant 
myrosinases, and given that most cruciferous vegetables consumed by humans are cooked, 
gut bacteria play a critical role in converting glucosinolates to ITC.
