Streptococcus infantis. The  development  of  chronic  diseases 
related to the exposure to environmental toxi­ 
cants are associated with age, and the bene­ 
fits of exercise are also being emphasized in 
older  individuals;  therefore,  we  used  aged 
mice   in  the  pres­ 
ent study. Older mice tend to have higher 
body  mass  than  younger  animals. reported that Erysipelotrichaceae 
were enriched in obese humans and mice, as 
well as in mice fed a high­fat diet, and noted 
that  the  abundance  of  Erysipelotrichaceae 
was  also  increased  in  patients  with  colo­ 
rectal cancer. Thus, our data are consistent 
because we observed a decrease in the num­ 
ber of Erysipelotrichaceae in exercised mice 
that had lost a substantial amount of body 
weight;  this  is  associated  with  the  role  of 
Erysipelotrichaceae in energy production and 
adiposity (Claus et al.
