All epithelial surfaces that interface with the external world harbor microbes, but the most
dense microbial communities are those in the distal intestinal tract. The
phylum Proteobacteria contains the gram-negative enterics that despite being well known to
clinicians, represent only a fraction of the gut microbial community  The dominance of
these four bacterial phyla and the relative absence of all other phyla suggests that, under
normal circumstances, the human-microbe relationship is highly selective and highly stable. In GF animals,
ketogenesis was markedly reduced, and it was shown that myocardial metabolism was
redirected towards glucose utilization. As a result, interventions in this
field have been introduced with a limited scientific foundation. As knowledge of the intestinal microbiome expands, it is likely that many
more potential probiotic species and prebiotic supplements will be identified..

Another possible approach to improve outcomes for critically ill patients is to manipulate the
intestinal microenvironment to maintain the local microbial ecology of the GI tract
indirectly. Most recently
we have shown that surgical injury causes a rapid depletion of mucus phosphate, thereby
inducing certain strains of pathogenic bacteria to upregulate their virulence against the
intestinal epithelial barrier  Most bacteria that cause serious infections in ICU patients
are equipped with exquisite sensory mechanisms to detect the level of local phosphate
concentration.
