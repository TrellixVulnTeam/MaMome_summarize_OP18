During pregnancy, inflammatory states vary from higher inflammation at implantation and 
in labor to lower levels of inflammation in mid-pregnancy (Trevisanuto et al., 2016; Kim, Romero, 
Chaemsaithong, & Kim, 2015). It is plausible that the hormone levels involved in 
increasing gut transit time are an adaptive response to allow greater nutrient and energy 
harvest, thus promoting weight gain in pregnancy..

In a recent clinical trial, supplementation with specific strains of probiotics, such as 
Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Lactobacillus acidophilus, combined with dietary 
counseling have been found to improve glucose metabolism in healthy pregnant and 
lactating women (Brantsaeter et al., Probiotic milk and other food products may, therefore, be worth consideration 
for women at greater risk for gestational diabetes, preeclampsia and some environmental 
toxins..

Diet and lifestyle practices are modifiable factors that can affect the brain-gut axis, and 
ultimately, the long-term health of women and infants.
