the dysbiosis of host gut microbiota and modulating of gut microbiota may be beneficial for
PCOS treatment. On day 36, all rat fecal samples were collected for real-time PCR analysis. The specific primers were
showed in S1 Table. The estrous cycle changes occurred twice in 2 rats, once in 4 rats,
and not at all in 2 rats (Fig 3)..

Under light microscopy, the control rat ovaries exhibited follicles in various stages of develop-
ment including secondary follicles, graafian follicles, and fresh corpora lutea. When PCOS rats were treated with FMT or Lactobacillus,
the testosterone and androstenedione levels were decreased significantly compared with those
in PCOS rats (Fig 5C and 5D). Estrous cycle changes in three representative rats from each group. Morphological changes of ovarian tissues. ( The results revealed that Lactobacillus, Rumi-
nococcus and Clostridium were lower and Prevotella was higher in PCOS group, there were no
statistically significant differences for Bifidobacterium, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus and Bac-
teroides in PCOS groups when compared with the control group..

Prevotella species are constituents of host-associated ecosystems in the respiratory tract,
oral cavity and genital tract. To further understand
effects of microbiota interventions on PCOS, PCOS rats were treated with FMT and Lactobacil-
lus transplantation. the natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microbiota  A previous study
showed that postmenopausal women with a more diverse gut microbiome exhibited elevated
urinary estrogens and estrogen metabolites  In the present study, with the decrease of
estradiol and estrone levels in PCOS rats, the colonization of Lactobacillus in the gut was
decreased. These data suggested that FMT and Lactoba-
cillus transplantation were helpful for the treatments of PCOS rats..

and found that dysbiosis of gut microbiota was associated with sex hormone levels, estrus
cycles and ovarian morphological changes.
