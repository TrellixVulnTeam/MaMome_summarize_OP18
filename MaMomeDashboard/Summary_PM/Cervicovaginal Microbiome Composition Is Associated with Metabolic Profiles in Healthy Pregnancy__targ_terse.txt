The human vaginal microbiome maintains low diversity in low-pH conditions and
depends on host sugars as carbon sources, with less access to dietary and exogenous
nutrients than the gut, skin, or oral cavity. While some
individuals exhibited a relatively stable microbial community over time, others 
experienced shifts in composition, resulting in a statistically signiﬁcant change in

absence of fungi, at the genus level, per sample. Indole-3-lactate (ILA) accounted for
27% of the variation observed in the vaginal microbiota data and was found to be more
abundant in vaginal microbiota with abundant L. crispatus . Detected
ions by MALDI were compared to those identiﬁed by GC-MS and LC-MS, and we found
that (cid:4)55% of the metabolites identiﬁed had corresponding ions in the MALDI analysis
(Table S1)..

Metagenomics and functional potential of communities. Indeed,
L. crispatus has been shown to have anti-Candida activity of
samples that were Candida positive came from individuals whose vaginal microbiota
were dominated by an organism other than L. crispatus..

A few metabolites were highly indicative of the bacterial community present in each
subject and may be useful biomarkers for the type of vaginal microbiota present. To this end, reducing fructose 6-phosphate to
mannitol-1-phosphate may be an alternative and vital way L. crispatus regenerates
NAD(cid:5) for glycolysis  We did ﬁnd the gene mannitol-1-phosphate dehydroge-
nase, responsible for converting fructose 6-phosphate to mannitol-1-phosphate, was
highly correlated (R2 (cid:2) 0.9) with the relative abundance of L. crispatus.
