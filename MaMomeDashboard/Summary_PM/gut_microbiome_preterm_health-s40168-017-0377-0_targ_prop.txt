Variance and abundance of taxa across three microbiota
phases
Taxonomic analysis of all samples identified 16 phyla, 38
classes, 73 orders, 158 families, and 383 genera. Changes in
taxa abundance would suggest adaptation of the micro-
biota in response to factors that the preterm infant en-
counters while in the NICU and may affect development
of a mature, functional gut microbiota. Abun-
dance of Bifidobacterium, an Actinobacterium most com-
monly linked with development and maintenance of the
healthy infant gut microbiota  is significantly asso-
ciated with lipid and protein intake in P3, with increased
Bifidobacterium abundance associated with increased lipid
in the diet and decreased abundance with greater amounts
of protein. A complete
list of nutrition and medication variables significantly
associated with changes in microbiota taxa in all the three
phases can be found in in Additional file 7: Table S6..

sought to identify dynamic aspects of host biology that
correspond to phase transition.
