Gut Microbiome in Human Health

INTRODUCTION

The human microbiome comprises of collective genomes of
microbiota inhabiting us, namely protozoa, archaea, eukaryotes,
viruses and predominantly bacteria that live symbiotically on and
within various sites of the human body. Until recent decades, the
properties of the human microbiome and the host–microbiota
interactions have been largely unknown due to technology
limitations especially in examining non-cultivable microbes
of interest, and lack of population-scale data depicting the
microbiota compositions and functions. impacts of diet

Human fecal

and metagenomic sequencing techniques reveal signiﬁcant
enrichment in metabolism of polysaccharides, amino acids,
xenobiotics and micronutrients conferred by gut microbiota,

activation will stimulate second messenger c-AMP production,
and the subsequent c-AMP-dependent downstream signaling,
inducing expressions of a multitude of genes, whereby its
physiological importance remains to be fully elucidated, pointing
