diseases may develop (Putignani et al., (i)
The “omics” technologies are presently applied to:
determine speciﬁc disease markers and novel diagnostic targets;
(ii) discover functional alterations in the physiopathology of
several diseases; (iii) discover the relationship between the gut
microbiota and the host metabolisms (De Preter and Verbeke,
2013). 2002); and (iv) characterize human health or disease
(Holmes et al., In fact,
the gut microbiota is involved in several biochemical functions
directly associated to the perturbation of speciﬁc gut microbial
populations, which may lead to the development of diseases
(De Preter, 2015; De Preter et al., Considering
that the amount of predictable metabolites and derivatives in
mammals, plants and bacteria is unknown (Weckwerth and
Morgenthal, 2005), there is the need of diﬀerent analytical
platforms and complex integrated computational pipelines,
to cover
adjusted by analytical and chemical parameters,
complete metabolome pathways
in the diﬀerent bioﬂuids
