C11_K211. The  development  of  chronic  diseases 
related to the exposure to environmental toxi­ 
cants are associated with age, and the bene­ 
fits of exercise are also being emphasized in 
older  individuals;  therefore,  we  used  aged 
mice   in  the  pres­ 
ent study. Older mice tend to have higher 
body  mass  than  younger  animals. In  fact, 
the average body weight of sedentary mice 
in the present study was 46.8 ± 1.4 g, and 
body weight of exercised mice was approxi­ 
mately 30% lower. indicated a strong association of 
the intestinal microbiome with the develop­ 
ment of obesity. Although  Enterococci  are  commensal 
bacteria, they are also important nosocomial 
pathogens  that  cause  bacteremia,  endo­ 
carditis, and other infections in humans. Some 
strains are resistant to multiple anti biotics and 
possess  virulence  factors,  such  as  adhesins, 
invasins, pili, and haemolysin (Willems et al. Nevertheless, E. faecium isolates from 
clinical outbreaks are different strains than 
E. faecium from animals, food, and humans 
in  the  community  (Franz  et  al. They are adminis­ 
tered to treat diarrhea, antibiotic­associated 
diarrhea,  and  irritable  bowel  syndrome;  to 
lower cholesterol levels; or to improve host 
immunity (Franz et al. This family plays 
an important role in metabolic disorders and 
energy metabo lism (Chen et al. reported that Erysipelotrichaceae 
were enriched in obese humans and mice, as 
well as in mice fed a high­fat diet, and noted 
that  the  abundance  of  Erysipelotrichaceae 
was  also  increased  in  patients  with  colo­ 
rectal cancer. Thus, our data are consistent 
because we observed a decrease in the num­ 
ber of Erysipelotrichaceae in exercised mice 
that had lost a substantial amount of body 
weight;  this  is  associated  with  the  role  of 
Erysipelotrichaceae in energy production and 
adiposity (Claus et al.
