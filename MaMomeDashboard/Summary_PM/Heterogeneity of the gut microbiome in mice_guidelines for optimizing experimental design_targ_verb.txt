Defects in host genes controlling bacterial homeostasis or al-
terations of the gut microbiota composition have been associ-
ated with complex diseases, including inflammatory bowel dis-
ease (IBD), diabetes mellitus (Pflughoeft and Versalovic 2012)
and asthma (Maslowski et al. 2013), it seems likely that bacterial communities
and not specific bacteria determine susceptibility towards com-
plex diseases, a concept that has been introduced as the ‘the
pathobiome’ (Vayssier-Taussat et al. 2013), and fecal microbiota transplantation is
highly effective for the treatment of recurrent Clostridium difficile
infection (Van Nood et al. In addition, simply cohousing lean and obese animals prevented
the obese phenotype and was associated with transfer of Bac-
teroidales, suggesting a phenotypic impact of horizontal micro-
bial transfer (Ridaura et al. 2013)..

light on bacterial functionality. 2012)..

GF animals were applied in the study of the involvement of
microbiota in diabetes, rheumatic arthritis and IBD (Bleich and
Hansen 2012). 2013), showing that colonization of Bacteroides
is species-specific and saturable. As in humans, the two most abundant bacte-
rial phyla in C57BL6/J mice are the Firmicutes (60–80% of se-
quences) and the Bacteroidetes  however, 85% of the
murine sequences represent species that have not been detected
in humans (Ley et al. Importantly, mice with mouse mi-
crobiota conferred better protection against Salmonella infection
than those with human microbiota. Together, these data sug-
gest a highly specific coexistence and mutual interaction be-
tween species-associated microbiota and the host immune sys-
tem, and that microbiota–host interactions in humans cannot
be completely mirrored in ‘humanized’ mice..

Although considerable literature exists about microbiota
transfer into GF animals, little is known about transferring mi-
crobiota into animals with non-GF intestines. However, antibiotic treatment is
not necessary to establish an exogenous microbiota (Manichanh
et al. In addition, bacterial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids
are well-known regulators of the host immune response (Macia
et al. Mice deficient in Nod2 are not
able to control Helicobacter hepaticus infection. Of high importance in orchestrating
intestinal barrier function and innate sensing are ILCs, which
are the resident immune cell regulators at epithelial surfaces
that share many of the CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell functions (Son-
nenberg and Artis 2012). The most convincing difference between cages is driven
by Helicobacter spp., 2002); however,
it is difficult to establish which is cause or consequence.
