FEMS Microbiology Reviews, 2016, Vol. Given
careful experimental design, the microbiome can be controlled
and manipulated more easily in animal models compared to hu-
man studies. For example, although the severity of colitis in
the commonly used dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) model criti-
cally depends on the presence of bacteria (Kitajima et al. Artificial colonization of GF mice with specific pathogen-free
(SPF) flora partly reversed the response to restraint stress (de-
fined by an increase of plasma cortisol levels) when the flora
was introduced at 6 weeks of age but not at 14 weeks of age
(Sudo et al. Bacteria originating from
the mother have been observed in the meconium of human and
murine neonates (Jim ´enez et al. Especially in the first week after weaning, co-
inciding with the introduction of solid food, the pups are chal-
lenged by a rapidly changing microbiota until intestinal home-
ostasis is established, which generally occurs 11–17 days after
weaning (Schloss et al. Conse-
quently, mice deficient for RORct are extremely susceptible to
DSS due to a loss of containment of a homeostatic microbiota
(Lochner et al. By contrast, others
showed that gender differences in microbiota composition do
exist but that this observation is genotype dependent (Fushuku
and Fukuda 2008a; Gomez et al. Besides strain and gender differences, investigators have
studied the effects of the allelic absence of specific genes on
the intestinal microbiota by comparing knockout with wild-type
mice. VARIABLES THAT AFFECT GUT MICROBIOTA
COMPOSITION RELATED TO ANIMAL
HOUSING

Variation in the microbiological environment between research
institutions or commercial breeding facilities is a confounding
factor; however. the exact contribution to experimental out-
comes is poorly understood. Viable counts
of the total bacterial load have revealed large differences in the
cecal microbiota among mice of the same strain from differ-
ent vendors (Hufeldt et al. This type of variation is not
restricted to commercially available strains but also plays a role
when comparing studies performed in different animal labora-

tory sources (Ubeda et al. This pathway regulates the expression
of IL-22 from RORct+ ILCs and lymphotoxin β receptor knock-
out mice fail to express sufficient IL-22 to eliminate mucosal
pathogens (Tumanov et al. Similarly, feeding mice a westernized, high-fat
diet changes gut microbial communities and accelerates age-
associated obesity (Poutahidis et al. Diet-induced changes in bile acid composition can also be
an important cause of modifications to the gut bacterial com-
munity. Control

ferent genotypes (e.g. wild type and knockout) has been shown
to change the gut microbial composition, affecting their natu-
ral immunological responses to a treatment or a disease trigger
(Garrett et al. In case the effect is more subtle,
it is recommended to separate littermate controls according to
their genotype right after weaning for at least 30 days before
the experiment so that the mice can develop their inherent mi-
crobiota; however, they should be divided over several cages. Collections of standardized microbiota

Establishing a collection of different standardized microbiotas
in isobiotic mice to be shared between institutions for repro-
ducible experimentation has been proposed (Hooper, Littman
and Macpherson 2012). Increasing evidence sug-
gests that the microbial environment influences the innate
and adaptive immune system and largely determines the out-
come of such investigations, even in disease models where the
microbiome is not under investigation. G.0787.13; G0C3114], a
