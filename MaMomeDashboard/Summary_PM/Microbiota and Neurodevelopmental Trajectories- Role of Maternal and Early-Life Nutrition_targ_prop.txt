Pregnancy
Pregnancy is a unique period in human life, and both 
the gut and vaginal microbiome have evolved to follow an 
optimum trajectory to support the mother and the devel-
oping fetus and allow for the ideal handover of microbi-
ome at birth, informing maternal and child health out-
comes. . Preclinical Models of Early-Life Microbiota Trajectory
Similar to humans, mice and rat intestinal and vaginal 
microbiota  go  through  compositional  changes  during 
pregnancy,  providing  a  robust  preclinical  model  for 
studying the link between maternal gut environment and 
offspring brain development  Early gestation is 
characterized  by  a  transitional  increase  in  the  relative 
abundance of Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium, which 
in late pregnancy decrease to levels seen in non-pregnant 
mice. In contrast, Bacteroides remain relatively elevated 
throughout  pregnancy    Interestingly,  microbiota . Gut  bacterial  composi-
tion  of  infants  exclusively  breastfed  is  characterized  by 
higher relative abundance of Bacteroides and Bifidobacte-
rium compared to the one from formula-fed infants [108, 
116]. Furthermore, breastfeeding had a positive effect on 
myelination and increased general, verbal and non-verbal 
cognitive abilities during childhood  The implica-
tions of these findings are still unclear, but longitudinal 
studies are starting to shed light on the effect of early-life 
nutrition on the temporal course of microbiota matura-
