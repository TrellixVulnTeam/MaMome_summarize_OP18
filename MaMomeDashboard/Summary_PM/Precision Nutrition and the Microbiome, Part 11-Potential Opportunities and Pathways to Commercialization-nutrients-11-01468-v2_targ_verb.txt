Interventions involving probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics and dietary ﬁbre also oﬀer opportunities
to “fertilize” our microbiota. Synbiotics describe the
combination of probiotics and prebiotics which act synergistically. It has
been suggested that the reduced alpha diversity in T3 may not be due to loss of species but rather
lower relative abundance levels below the sequencing level of detection  The over-represented
OTUs in T1 mainly belonged to the Clostridiales order of the Firmicutes and included butyrate
producers such as Facalibacterium and Eubacterium  Members of the Enterobacteriaceae family and
the Streptococcus genus were over-represented in T3 samples. In T3 and just before transmission of the microbiota
to the newborn, each mother has a “purely personal” microbiota which is suggested to have been
selected at the level of each host lineage to ensure maximum development of the developing foetus
and newborn  Transferring T3 microbiota to germ-free mice resulted in increased adiposity and
reduced insulin sensitivity compared to T1 microbiota  The study indicates that the microbial
changes which occur during pregnancy inﬂuence host metabolism and are beneﬁcial for that stage
in life. who also reviewed the potential of
the microbiota as a therapeutic target in GDM and concluded that certain microbiota-accessible
carbohydrates (MACs) could beneﬁcially modulate the gut microbiota and hence host metabolism
in GDM patients. For example,
consumption of the probiotics Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Biﬁdobacterium lactis BB12 from T1
of pregnancy in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study signiﬁcantly reduced the incidence of GDM
(P = 0.003)  However, probiotic supplementation for four weeks (weeks 24 to 28 of gestation)
in obese pregnant women did not inﬂuence maternal metabolic proﬁle, fasting blood glucose, or
pregnancy outcomes  It is possible that the short-term probiotic consumption in this study did not
permit the probiotic to induce beneﬁcial changes to the gut microbiota and hence host metabolism. lactis plus
the prebiotic inulin compared to a rate of 12% in the prebiotic group and 18% in the control group 
The prebiotic FOS in combination with a probiotic mixture consisting of L. acidophilus, Biﬁdobacterium
longum, Biﬁdobacterium biﬁdum, and Streptococcus thermophilus signiﬁcantly reduced the incidence of
NEC in preterm infants fed breast milk compared to the control group who
received breast milk alone  In the same study the incidences of Stage
II and Stage III (severe) NEC were nil in the test group compared to 5 and 2 cases in the control. In a study involving 192 breast-fed infants, Hill et al. While consumption of a probiotic
cheese containing L. rhamnosus HN001 and L. acidophilus NCFM by an elderly population increased the
numbers of said probiotics in faeces, there was no eﬀect on faecal immune markers  However,
the probiotic cheese was associated with a trend towards lower C. diﬃcile counts, an eﬀect which was
statistically signiﬁcant in the subpopulation that were found to harbor C. diﬃcile at the beginning of the
study. longum Bar33 and Lactobacillus
helveticus Bar13) per day for one month was found to revert the age-related increase in the following. The probiotic modulated the gut microbiota transcriptome. Decreases in the levels of Ruminococcaceae and Parabacteroides
have been pinpointed as the main microbial shifts associated with ageing in mice  Slight
reductions were observed in Oscillospira (positively associated with leanness and health  and
the sulphate-reducing Desulfovibrio following L. rhamnosus GG with soluble corn ﬁbre consumption,
whereas only Desulfovibrio decreased following intake of L. rhamnosus GG PB12 with corn ﬁbre..

In order to better understand the impact of exercise on the gut microbiota, Estaki et al. Chronic fatigue syndrome is characterised by persistent and relapsing tiredness and 97% of
patients report neurological disturbances resulting in a variety of emotional symptoms of which
anxiety and depression are the most common  In a pilot study involving 39 chronic fatigue
syndrome patients intake of L. casei strain Shirota for two months resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in
anxiety symptoms compared with the control group (P = 0.01)  Lactobacillus and biﬁdobacteria
counts were also signiﬁcantly increased as a result of probiotic administration. In another study involving overweight and obese pregnant
women, low ﬁbre intake was found to increase the genus Collinsella in the gut microbiota, which is
positively associated with circulating insulin  The low ﬁbre diet was also associated with a
gut microbiota favouring lactate fermentation, whereas the high ﬁbre diet was associated with SCFA
producing bacteria..
