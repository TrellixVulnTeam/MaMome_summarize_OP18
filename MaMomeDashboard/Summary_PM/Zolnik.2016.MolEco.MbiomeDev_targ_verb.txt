relationships
between internal microorganisms and I. scapularis have
focused on commonly studied human pathogens. This tick
experiences a 2-year life cycle, feeding once per life
stage (larva, nymph, and adult) on vertebrate blood. A total of 6 908 532 sequences passed ﬁlter
and were assigned taxonomy. The negative control resulted in <0.001%
(n = 606) of all sequences and was excluded from fur-
ther analysis. Rarefaction curves from a depth of 1000 to
100 000 sequences indicated sufﬁcient sequencing cov-
erage, as demonstrated by observed OTU accumulation
curves reaching a plateau (Fig. The relative abundance
of non-Rickettsia taxa increased along developmental
stages (i.e. larvae to nymphs to adults) with the excep-
tion of adult females, which displayed the highest rela-
tive abundance of Rickettsia of all ﬁeld-collected life
stages . Freshly hatched larvae also had a high
relative abundance of Rickettsia . Seven taxa were
found in all female and all freshly hatched larvae sam-
ples (matching to the genera Rickettsia, Phyllobacterium,
Burkholderia, Sphingomonas, Pseudomonas and the families
Comamonadaceae
and Oxalobacteraceae); however,
females harboured more observed OTUs than freshly
hatched larvae . Wolbachia was the genus with the second highest. Both Borrelia and Anaplasma were only found in
nymphs and adults..

Dermacentor and Haemaphysalis ticks (Piesman & Gage
2004), Rickettsia amblyommii isolated from the American
lone star tick Amblyomma americanum (Stromdahl et al. Overall, short
sequences could not be unambiguously placed on single
branches, but were rather assigned along a clade, which
lends a certain degree of conﬁdence. The
placement of our sequences on the reference tree can be
explored interactively on the iToL webserver (http://
itol.embl.de/tree/286234201192691468834200)..

blacklegged ticks (Moreno et al. Rickettsia are obligate, intracellular bacteria associ-
ated with eukaryotes,
including arthropods (Perlman
et al. The Rickettsia endosym-
biont of I. scapularis, presumed to be nonpathogenic, has
been identiﬁed in this tick in previous studies (Noda
et al. Our study
focused on an area with one of the highest pathogen
prevalence levels in blacklegged ticks. Future studies
examining the functional interplay between tick micro-
biomes and pathogens over a larger geographic region
are warranted.
