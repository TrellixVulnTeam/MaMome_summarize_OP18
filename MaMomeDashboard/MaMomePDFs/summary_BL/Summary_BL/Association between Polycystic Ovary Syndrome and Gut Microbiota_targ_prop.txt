the dysbiosis of host gut microbiota and modulating of gut microbiota may be beneficial for
PCOS treatment. All
animal experiments were approved by the Animal Care Committee of Dalian Medical Univer-
sity, China (SCXK-2013-0003). In this experiment, 32 female SD rats were randomly assigned into 4
groups of 8 rats each, including a control group that received a gavage of normal saline, and
three treatment groups (PCOS, PCOS FMT and PCOS Lactobacillus transplantation groups)
administered a gavage of letrozole (Novartis Pharma Schweiz AG, Switzerland) at a concentra-
tion of 1 mg/kg once daily for 21 consecutive days. Control rat
fecal samples and PCOS rat fecal samples were used for DGGE analysis to evaluate the gut
microbiota shift in PCOS rats. On day 36, all rat fecal samples were collected for real-time PCR analysis. The specific primers were
showed in S1 Table. Lactobacillus treatment group
(MeanÂ±sem). On the 7th day after
PCOS rats were treated with FMT, epithelial keratinocytes were observed microscopically dur-
ing estrus in the vaginal smears of 3 rats; on the 14th day epithelial keratinocytes were observed
in all of the 8 rats. In addition, many large cysts with virtually no granu-
losa layer or scant granulosa were observed. The results revealed that Lactobacillus, Rumi-
nococcus and Clostridium were lower and Prevotella was higher in PCOS group, there were no
statistically significant differences for Bifidobacterium, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus and Bac-
teroides in PCOS groups when compared with the control group..

Prevotella species are constituents of host-associated ecosystems in the respiratory tract,
oral cavity and genital tract. In addition,
compared with Lactobacillus transplantation group, FMT group had better recovery effects on
sex hormone levels and estrus cycles.
