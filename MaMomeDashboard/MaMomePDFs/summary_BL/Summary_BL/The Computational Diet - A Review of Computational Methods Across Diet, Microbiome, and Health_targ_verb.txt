For example, species of beneﬁcial bacteria
such as Lactobacillus and Biﬁdobacterium have been found to be
dominant in breastfed infants while species of harmful bacteria
such as Clostridium, Granulicatella, Citrobacter, Enterobacter,
and Bilophila have been found to be dominant in formula-fed
infants (Bäckhed et al., In addition, breastfed babies have
higher gut microbial diversity compared to formula-fed babies,
and several studies indicate that the diversity of bacteria is directly
connected to health (Wang et al., An
unbalanced composition of the infant’s gut microbiota has been
linked to several childhood diseases, including atopic dermatitis
(AD) (Abrahamsson et al., 2008)..

the USDA food composition database (US Department of
Agriculture and Agricultural Research Service, 2010) and the
Canadian nutrient ﬁle (Canada, 2010). Note that microbiota
of dietary intake can be characterized using metagenomic
sequencing as reviewed previously,
if not already deﬁned
[e.g., probiotics with predeﬁned strains (Sánchez et al., 2017)].
Some studies perform metabolic characterization of dietary
intake directly (Quinn et al., 2016), while others rely on pre-
characterized metabolic proﬁles (Zhao et al., A signiﬁcant
limitation of any analysis is that food composition databases
characterize only 0.5% of the known nutritional compounds
(Barabási et al., 2019)..

Example: Metagenomic analysis of feces samples tells us that Person A has 5 reads mapped to
bacterium Escherichia coli, while person B has 10. Can we conclude that this bacterium is more
populated in the gut of person B compared to person A? Answer: No, read counts cannot be
compared across samples. Solutions: (I) Convert read counts to relative abundances before comparison. ( II) If an optimization
problem is deﬁned using read counts, add constraint for total counts per sample.
