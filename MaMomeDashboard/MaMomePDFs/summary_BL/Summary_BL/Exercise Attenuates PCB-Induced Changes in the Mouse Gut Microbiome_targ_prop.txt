Tenericutes, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes. Staphylococcus epidermidis
Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron strain 8669. In line with these 
reports,  it  is  relevant  that  we  detected  an 
increased abundance of several Firmicutes, 
primarily Enterococcaceae (e.g., Enterococcus 
faecium), in the exercised mice. . Thus, our data are consistent 
because we observed a decrease in the numÂ­ 
ber of Erysipelotrichaceae in exercised mice 
that had lost a substantial amount of body 
weight;  this  is  associated  with  the  role  of 
Erysipelotrichaceae in energy production and 
adiposity (Claus et al.
