A total of 21 samples – three pools for each of the ﬁve
life stage categories (lab-reared larvae, ﬁeld-collected
larvae, ﬁeld-collected nymphs, ﬁeld-collected adult
females, and ﬁeld-collected adult males), and three
pools for female salivary glands and female midguts –
generated 10 896 297 raw reads on one Illumina MiSeq
ﬂow cell. Wolbachia was the genus with the second highest. Although
individual short sequences could not be assigned to sin-
gle tree branches with full conﬁdence, they were mostly
assigned to neighbouring branches within a clade of sis-
ter endosymbionts isolated from the same tick species.
