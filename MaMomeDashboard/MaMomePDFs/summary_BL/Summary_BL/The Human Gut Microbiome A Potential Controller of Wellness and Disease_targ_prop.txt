Vitamin-K-producing gut bacteria
namely Bacteroides fragilis, Eubacterium lentum, Enterobacter
agglomerans, Serratia marcescens, and Enterococcus faecium
(Fernandez and Collins, 1987; Cooke et al., 2006) anaerobically
synthesize vitamin K2 (menaquinone) which is essential
in
decreasing vascular calciÔ¨Åcation, elevating HDL and lowering
cholesterol levels, contributing to lower risk of cardiovascular
disorders such as atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease
(Kawashima et al., However, the possible link between loss of
vitamin-producing gut microbiota and disease onset has not yet
been elucidated..
