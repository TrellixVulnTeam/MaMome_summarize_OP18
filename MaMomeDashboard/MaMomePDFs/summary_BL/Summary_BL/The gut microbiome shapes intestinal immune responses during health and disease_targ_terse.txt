rates of cell turnover in germ-free animals compared with wild-type animals13. Establishing an infection requires the initial task of colonizing the host. Recent studies suggest that inflammation induced in response to S. typhimurium changes the
composition of the microbiota and suppresses its regrowth. These studies support the idea that enteric pathogens
such as S. typhimurium may have developed strategies to counter both the immune system
and the microbiota during the infectious process..

IBD involves a shift from a regulated intestinal immune responses to one that is driven by
unrestrained immune-cell activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production474849. In a model of disease induced by the adoptive transfer of pathogenic T cells into
immunodeficient (Scid−/− or Rag−/−) recipient mice, colonization of animals with intestinal
pathogens such as Helicobacter hepaticus was found to exacerbate inflammation59. The common feature
of almost all bacterial species used as probiotics is the ability of these organisms to control
inflammation.
