tobacilli are rarely detected as markers of the gastrointes-
tinal microbiota dysbiosis, but such reports exist and

include a reduced abundance in patients suffering from
inﬂammatory bowel disease (Keighley et al., Nevertheless, other representatives of

normal gastrointestinal microbiota. Currently, no particu-
lar function has been assigned to this bacterial group,
although there is evidence that these bacteria are active in
the distal parts of the gastrointestinal tract (Peris-Bondia
et al., According to the current convention, all
Blastocystis isolated from humans are identiﬁed as Blasto-
cystis hominis, although their SSU rRNA gene sequence
analysis showed that nine different phylotypes of these
organisms can be detected in the human gastrointestinal
tract (Arisue et al.,
