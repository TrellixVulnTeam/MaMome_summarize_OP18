the dysbiosis of host gut microbiota and modulating of gut microbiota may be beneficial for
PCOS treatment. In this experiment, 32 female SD rats were randomly assigned into 4
groups of 8 rats each, including a control group that received a gavage of normal saline, and
three treatment groups (PCOS, PCOS FMT and PCOS Lactobacillus transplantation groups)
administered a gavage of letrozole (Novartis Pharma Schweiz AG, Switzerland) at a concentra-
tion of 1 mg/kg once daily for 21 consecutive days. In order to quantify the differences of microbita for all rats on
day 21, real-time PCR analysis was applied. Lactobacillus treatment group
(MeanÂ±sem). The estrous cycle changes occurred twice in 2 rats, once in 4 rats,
and not at all in 2 rats (Fig 3)..

Under light microscopy, the control rat ovaries exhibited follicles in various stages of develop-
ment including secondary follicles, graafian follicles, and fresh corpora lutea. In addition, many large cysts with virtually no granu-
losa layer or scant granulosa were observed.
