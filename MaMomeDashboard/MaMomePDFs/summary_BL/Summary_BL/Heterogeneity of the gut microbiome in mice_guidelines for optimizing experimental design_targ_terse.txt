Defects in host genes controlling bacterial homeostasis or al-
terations of the gut microbiota composition have been associ-
ated with complex diseases, including inflammatory bowel dis-
ease (IBD), diabetes mellitus (Pflughoeft and Versalovic 2012)
and asthma (Maslowski et al. Finally, since immune struc-
tures in GF mice remain immature, much of our understanding
of host–microbe interactions involved in the development of the
immune system arose from the study of GF animals and is dis-
cussed in more detail later in this review..

An important limitation in murine microbial studies is the dif-
ference in bacterial composition between mice and humans. Transplantation has also been used in
mouse models of enteric infections. We
demonstrated that cohousing of mice from the age of 4 weeks
determines the sensitivity towards DSS-induced colitis, inde-
pendent of the specific genotype (Brinkman et al. 2013;
Lawley and Walker 2013; Sommer and B ¨ackhed 2013).Vice versa,
the established adult microbiota provides protection against
potential pathogens via direct inhibition or nutrient depletion. As in-
nate sensors, they respond and divide rapidly upon stimulation.
