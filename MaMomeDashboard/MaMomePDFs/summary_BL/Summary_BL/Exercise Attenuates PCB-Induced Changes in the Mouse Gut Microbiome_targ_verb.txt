C11_K211. The  development  of  chronic  diseases 
related to the exposure to environmental toxi­ 
cants are associated with age, and the bene­ 
fits of exercise are also being emphasized in 
older  individuals;  therefore,  we  used  aged 
mice   in  the  pres­ 
ent study. Older mice tend to have higher 
body  mass  than  younger  animals. indicated a strong association of 
the intestinal microbiome with the develop­ 
ment of obesity. Genetically obese ob/ob mice 
were charac terized by a major decrease in the 
abundance of Bacteroidetes and an increase 
in Firmicutes compared with lean ob/+ wild­ 
type littermates and lean  ob/+ mothers fed 
the same diets. Similar changes were observed 
in wild­type mice fed a high fat/high poly­ 
saccharide diet (Turnbaugh et al. In 
another study, overweight pregnant patients 
had  reduced  abundance  of  Bifidobacteria 
and Bacteroidetes and increased abundance 
of selected Firmicutes (e.g., Staphylococcus) 
and Proteobacteria (e.g., Enterobacteriaceae) 
(Santacruz et al. In line with these 
reports,  it  is  relevant  that  we  detected  an 
increased abundance of several Firmicutes, 
primarily Enterococcaceae (e.g., Enterococcus 
faecium), in the exercised mice. . Although  Enterococci  are  commensal 
bacteria, they are also important nosocomial 
pathogens  that  cause  bacteremia,  endo­ 
carditis, and other infections in humans. Nevertheless, E. faecium isolates from 
clinical outbreaks are different strains than 
E. faecium from animals, food, and humans 
in  the  community  (Franz  et  al. fact, several enterococci, including E. faecium 
strains, are used as probiotics in the form of 
pharmaceutical preparations. Thus, our data are consistent 
because we observed a decrease in the num­ 
ber of Erysipelotrichaceae in exercised mice 
that had lost a substantial amount of body 
weight;  this  is  associated  with  the  role  of 
Erysipelotrichaceae in energy production and 
adiposity (Claus et al.
