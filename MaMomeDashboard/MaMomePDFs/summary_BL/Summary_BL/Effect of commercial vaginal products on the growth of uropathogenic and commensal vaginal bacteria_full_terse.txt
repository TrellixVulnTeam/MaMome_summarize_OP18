of intravaginal nonoxyl-9 (an ingredient in spermicide and a commonly used cytotoxic control) and univer-
sal placebo gel (isotonic) found that both have inflammatory effects on cells of the cervix and endometrium12. When exposed to a 
1:100 dilution of KY Jelly, Replens Long-Lasting moisturizer, or Trimo-San in KSF, the laboratory strain of E. coli 
was inhibited compared to a KSF media control (p = 0.01, Fig. While it is reassuring that these products have a uniformly negative effect on uropath-
ogenic E. coli in vitro, the abrogation of this effect in the presence of human vaginal epithelial cells suggests that 
the interaction may not be that simple. Our study is limited by the lack of a better human vaginal model. However, for lactobacilli, OD 
results were very different from CFU results due to significant clumping of bacteria in the presence of lubricants, 
thus only CFU were used. Vaginal epithelial cell co-culture with vaginal product and bacteria.
