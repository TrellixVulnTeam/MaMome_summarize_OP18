between the gut microbiome and CVDs to promote an understanding of the latest perspectives of the
role of the gut microbiome in CVDs. In addition, the distribution of TMAO levels
in the general population is unknown, and standard reference values are not currently available 
A detailed understanding of the biological role of TMAO in CVD patients is crucial for evaluating
the feasibility of developing drugs that affect the TMAO levels or the possibility of using TMAO as a
marker of CVD. Acute myocardial infarction

Faecalibacterium prausnitzii decreased in the HF patients compared to the controls. The results of
these studies suggest that an altered gut microbiome may have an impact on the development and
progression of heart failure. Author Contributions: T.Y. conceived and wrote the manuscript and made critical revisions.
