Introduction

Over the past decade, the essential role that the gut micro-
biota plays in the developmental programming of the neo-
nate, including growth trajectories, metabolism, and immune 
and cognitive development, has been demonstrated  
Thus, fostering the development of the microbiome in the 
first 1000 days of life is critical to supporting lifelong health. Ho and colleagues 
reported  that  non-exclusively  BF  infants  have  a  lower 
abundance of Proteobacteria, but only among those deliv-
ered via cesarean section (C-section)  However, breast-
feeding  appears  to  moderate  the  detrimental  effects  of 
C-section delivery and intrapartum antibiotics on the early 
microbiota, producing a microbiota profile more similar to 
that of vaginally delivered infants or those not receiving 
antibiotics  Geography and ethnicity are also important 
to take into account. Additionally,  children  may  also  be 
more similar to each other than adults are. Nearly all studies are cross-sectional, they use differ-
ent types of questionnaires to collect dietary intake data, and 
many of the studies have compared children living in rural 
vs. urban settings. Most prebiotics are DF, but not all DF 
are considered to be prebiotics. They observed that infants whose 
mother received probiotics had lower counts of Bifidobacte-
rium and a higher percentage of Lactobacillus/Enterococcus 
than placebo at 6 months of age  In addition, several 
groups investigated the diversity of infant microbiota, report-
ing that administration of probiotics during pregnancy and 
lactation, or directly to infants after delivery have no or lim-
ited effects on alpha and beta diversity of infant microbiota 
(Table 3).
