Interventions
The treatment group received oral probiotic capsules con-
taining 2.5 billion CFUs each of L. rhamnosus GR-1and L.
reuteri RC-14, while the placebo group received identical
capsules containing excipients alone (Chr. The contents of both capsules are stable
at room temperature, and enough capsules were provided
to each participant at the time of enrolment to last until
42 weeks’ gestation. We cultured the lactobacilli
from a
sample of the probiotic capsules before the start of the trial
to ensure they were viable and could be detected by our
culture techniques. Participants were instructed to take one
capsule daily until delivery and self-report compliance at
each study visit.25. Outcomes
Our primary outcome was the rate of BV at 18–20 weeks’
gestation, measured using the Nugent
(Nugent
score ≥7 shows presence of BV). Secondary outcomes were
vaginal colonisation rates at 18–20 weeks’ gestation of the
probiotic or other Lactobacillus spp., two common neonatal
pathogens (Escherichia coli and Group B streptococcus),
and the composition of the vaginal microbiota..

Sample size
A sample size of 366 was calculated to estimate the propor-
tion of recruited women who would complete the study. There were no differences in characteristics of partici-
pants between the two groups at baseline (Table 1). There were no differences between
the groups
in the rates of vaginal colonisation with
L. rhamnosus GR-1  E. coli
or Group B strepto-
cocci  Vaginal colonisation with
L. reuteri RC-14 was not detected in either
group
(Table 1). PCR ampliﬁca-
tion at baseline failed in two participants in each group,
and the 18–20 weeks’ gestation swabs from three partici-
pants were unavailable, leaving 147 participants who pro-
vided 299 samples (75 in each group at baseline, and 74
and 75 in the probiotic and placebo groups, respectively, at
18–20 weeks’). The 16S rRNA genes were successfully
ampliﬁed and sequenced from these, and 6714 sequence
reads were sub-sampled from each sample. The composi-
tion of the vaginal community was as expected, with sub-
sets dominated by Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus. The bio-
logical effects were measured by Nugent scoring and cul-
three time points
ture of vaginal samples collected at
during pregnancy..

Main ﬁndings
The oral administration of L. rhamnosus GR-1 and L. reu-
teri RC-14 daily from early pregnancy did not affect the
prevalence of BV or common neonatal pathogens, or alter. Maternal characteristics
