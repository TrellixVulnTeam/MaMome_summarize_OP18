Variance and abundance of taxa across three microbiota
phases
Taxonomic analysis of all samples identified 16 phyla, 38
classes, 73 orders, 158 families, and 383 genera. 1f, which
represents the abundance of genera relative to bar size. A complete
list of nutrition and medication variables significantly
associated with changes in microbiota taxa in all the three
phases can be found in in Additional file 7: Table S6..

sought to identify dynamic aspects of host biology that
correspond to phase transition. Consistent with other studies, we determined that this
programmed, non-random developmental succession of
microbiota is largely determined by PMA  What
drives this patterned succession toward a homeostatic
relationship between the infant and colonizing microbiota
is not known, but likely involves complex interactions be-
tween the mucosal immune system as well as metabolic
interactions within the gut microbial community and the
surrounding tissue and microenvironment, which remain
dynamic during periods of gastrointestinal development in
early life.
