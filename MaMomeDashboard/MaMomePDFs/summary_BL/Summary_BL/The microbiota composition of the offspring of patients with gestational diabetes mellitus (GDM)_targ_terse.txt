The possibility of early modulation of the offspring gut microbiota by acting on specific
maternal factors and/or characteristics is of potential great interest. Nevertheless, only few
data are available about the associations between maternal characteristics and newborn micro-
biota pattern. In multiple regression analyses, a significant association
between breastfeeding and the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium in the infant gut micro-
biota was found (β = 22.9; 95%CI = 10.1–35.7; P = 0.0017)..

In order to explore the possible mother-to-infant gut microbiota transmission at sub-OTUs
level, we carried out oligotyping on sequences of Blautia, Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium
since these were the only genera showing a Shannon entropy index sufficient to identify all. At genus level, higher abundance of Staphylococcus, Ralstonia,
Lactobacillus and some members of Enterobacteriaceae were observed in the offspring from
healthy women (S5B Fig)..

In the comparison between the two groups of breastfed infants, the offspring of GDM
women showed a significantly higher relative abundance of Escherichia and Parabacteroides
(P<0.001)..

The microbiota of infants from GDM women showed a low complexity, a high inter-individ-
ual variability, and was influenced by early maternal nutrition and breastfeeding. statistically significant, relative abundance of Parabacteroides across pregnancy from enrol-
ment to study end. Inner black bars indicate the presence of an oligotype in a given sample.
