Competing Interests: The authors have declared
that no competing interests exist. We hope that our results will shed a new light
on the pathogenesis and treatment for PCOS. All
animal experiments were approved by the Animal Care Committee of Dalian Medical Univer-
sity, China (SCXK-2013-0003). In this experiment, 32 female SD rats were randomly assigned into 4
groups of 8 rats each, including a control group that received a gavage of normal saline, and
three treatment groups (PCOS, PCOS FMT and PCOS Lactobacillus transplantation groups)
administered a gavage of letrozole (Novartis Pharma Schweiz AG, Switzerland) at a concentra-
tion of 1 mg/kg once daily for 21 consecutive days. The establishment of PCOS rat model was
similar to that of Kalafi. On day 36, all rat fecal samples were collected for real-time PCR analysis. The specific primers were
showed in S1 Table. Morphological observation

On day 36  all rats were sacri-
ficed. However, the changes
of the DGGE band profiles were difficult to be quantified by observation. These seven bands were
the top seven bands with the greatest density differences between the control and PCOS group. A) DGGE profiles in the fecal microbiota of control group and PCOS group (control group: C1-C6; PCOS group:
P1-P6). Arrows 1–7 were the bands selected for sequence. ( B) Cluster analysis of the DGGE profiles. Quantitation analyses of selected bacterial groups in fecal samples on days 21 and 36 by real-time PCR. * p<0.05 results which are signiﬁcantly different versus control group
# p<0.05 data are signiﬁcantly different versus PCOS group. On the 7th day after
PCOS rats were treated with FMT, epithelial keratinocytes were observed microscopically dur-
ing estrus in the vaginal smears of 3 rats; on the 14th day epithelial keratinocytes were observed
in all of the 8 rats. The estrous cycle changes occurred twice in 2 rats, once in 4 rats,
and not at all in 2 rats (Fig 3). In addition, many large cysts with virtually no granu-
losa layer or scant granulosa were observed. Groups are as follows: (A) Control group; (B) PCOS group; (C) PCOS Lactobacillus transplantation group; (D) PCOS FMT group. Morphological changes of ovarian tissues. ( Recently, letrozole-induced PCOS rat model was used in several papers to evaluate
effects of new therapeutic methods for PCOS  which illustrated the recognition of this

Every 10th section of 8 rats in each group was calculated. Comparisons of serum sex steroids at 36 days. p < 0.05 versus control group, # p < 0.05 versus PCOS group. DGGE analysis is a semiquantitative technique, the band density does not accu-
rately relate to its abundance. Lactobacillus plays an important role in the maintenance of human health by stimulating

the natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microbiota  A previous study
showed that postmenopausal women with a more diverse gut microbiome exhibited elevated
urinary estrogens and estrogen metabolites  In the present study, with the decrease of
estradiol and estrone levels in PCOS rats, the colonization of Lactobacillus in the gut was
decreased. Furthermore, microbiota interventions by FMT
and Lactobacillus transplantation could decrease the androgen level and increase the estrogen
level in blood serum, improve ovarian disorder and estrus cycles in PCOS rats. In addition,
compared with Lactobacillus transplantation group, FMT group had better recovery effects on
sex hormone levels and estrus cycles. 16S rRNA gene-targeted group-specific primers used in this study. Quantity analysis of the sequenced bands. a IOD: Integrated optical density; b Cal-
