Trial enrolled 881 pregnant women at 3 clinical sites in the US
(Boston, Massachusetts; St. Louis, Missouri; and San Diego,
California). However, after adjusting
for demographic variables (mode of delivery, age, treatment,
maternal education, and race/ethnicity), breastfeeding vs
formula feeding and solid food introduction, the only asso-
ciation between the maternal diet and taxa selected a priori
for analysis was a positive association with Lactobacillus spp
(mean difference = 0.48; P = .02). In analyses of genera
selected a priori for analysis, adjusted for demographic factors,
we observed signiﬁcantly higher relative abundances of
Biﬁdobacterium spp (mean difference 0.51; P = .02), Lactoba-
cillus spp (mean difference 3.87; P < .001), and Clostridium spp
(mean difference 0.75; P = .05) among breastfed vs formula-
fed infants. †Dietary variables: infant breastfeeding vs formula feeding and infant solid food. Given that we used an abbreviated

assessment tool for maternal diet and that our use of princi-
pal components only captured some of its variability, future
work using a more detailed dietary assessment tool may better
identify associations between the maternal diet during preg-
nancy and the child microbiome. Racial/ethnic differences could
be explained by differences in maternal education; however,
given the strong association between race/ethnicity and maternal
