of intravaginal nonoxyl-9 (an ingredient in spermicide and a commonly used cytotoxic control) and univer-
sal placebo gel (isotonic) found that both have inflammatory effects on cells of the cervix and endometrium12. Additionally, individual ingredients commonly used in vaginal products have been found to alter the electrical 
resistance and morphology of ectocervical tissue13, and hyperosmolar lubricants have been demonstrated to be 
cytotoxic to vaginal epithelial cells, some of them also altering inflammatory mediators14. To assess the ability of products to inhibit E. coli growth, a mixture of E. coli broth culture, nutrient 
media and product (neat, or diluted 1:2 in sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to facilitate pipetting for Trimo-San 
and Replens Long-Lasting) was incubated at 37 °C and compared to the addition of nutrient media alone. To test the observed interactions in a more high-fidelity model, the vaginal products with the most significant 
inhibitory effects in simple co-culture were then co-cultured with bacteria in the presence of an immortalized 
vaginal epithelial cell line (VK2, ATCC, VA) grown in keratinocyte serum-free (KSF) media. L. crispatus growth was stimulated by Replens Silky Smooth (p < 0.01). Change in bacterial growth with exposure to vaginal products. ( no VK2 cells

while Replens Silky Smooth increased growth. Not 
only does adherence potentially permit bacterial proliferation over that seen in liquid media, bacterial microcol-
onization of epithelial cell surfaces may also allow bacteria to access additional food sources. While it is reassuring that these products have a uniformly negative effect on uropath-
ogenic E. coli in vitro, the abrogation of this effect in the presence of human vaginal epithelial cells suggests that 
the interaction may not be that simple. This suggests factors in 
addition to concentration of product may contribute to bacterial survival or growth. In addition, the negative 
impact of some vaginal products on Lactobacillus spp. Our study is limited by the lack of a better human vaginal model. The 1:100 product dilution needed to allow 
vaginal epithelial viability is not realistically translated to clinical use. We only tested the effects of products on L. crispatus, which is one of the most common vaginal species, 
and is being tested as a potential live biotherapeutic. Materials and Methods
Bacterial culture preparation. The bacterial species used in these experiments include a laboratory strain 
of E. coli (ATCC 8739) and 6 clinical strains of E. coli provided by the Massachusetts General Hospital microbi-
ology lab, which had been isolated from women with cystitis. The following lubricants were used undiluted: KY Jelly, Replens Silky 
Smooth lubricant, generic coconut oil. Plates were incubated at 37 °C 
with agitation for 6 hours. The plates were incubated anaerobically at 37 °C without agitation 
for 12 hours. However, for lactobacilli, OD 
results were very different from CFU results due to significant clumping of bacteria in the presence of lubricants, 
thus only CFU were used. For both the E. coli and L. crispatus co-cultures, all experiments were performed at least twice, with each 
biological replicate containing technical triplicates for each condition, including blank control conditions. All 
ingredients were plated on agar to confirm viability of the broth pre-cultures and sterility of test materials. Vaginal epithelial cell co-culture with vaginal product and bacteria. Bacterial broths 
were prepared as described previously, and then centrifuged at 1000 RPM for 5 minutes. Cell death was assessed with a lactate dehydro-
genase cytotoxicity assay (Fisher Scientific, MA). After a 24-hour equilibration to allow vaginal cells to adhere to the plate and become confluent, 25 µL of the 
laboratory strain E. coli suspended in KSF were added to the vaginal epithelial cells with 75 µL of fresh KSF media 
and incubated for 1 hour. Then 50 µL of KY Jelly, Replens Long-Lasting moisturizer, or Trimo-San were added, 
diluted 1:100 with KSF cell culture medium. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.
