Holscher et al. Dimension reduction and clustering methods in associa-
tion studies. Mice offer a model in which differences in the gut microbiota
may be studied in a controlled experimental context, allowing
for the determination of causality and development of

mechanistic hypotheses  For example, transplantation
of isolated strains or communities of bacteria into germ-free
mice is one of the best models in use to demonstrate causal
relations between the gut microbiota and host metabolism
 This approach has been used in studies such as
Kovatcheva-Datchary et al. To get a full picture of the
individual that captures this complexity requires researchers
to learn how to design, conduct, and analyze studies that
focus on the detailed characterization of the individual and
their metabolic phenotype.
