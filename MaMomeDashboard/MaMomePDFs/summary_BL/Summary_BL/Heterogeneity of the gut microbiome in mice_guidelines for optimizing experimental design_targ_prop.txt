Defects in host genes controlling bacterial homeostasis or al-
terations of the gut microbiota composition have been associ-
ated with complex diseases, including inflammatory bowel dis-
ease (IBD), diabetes mellitus (Pflughoeft and Versalovic 2012)
and asthma (Maslowski et al. As in humans, the two most abundant bacte-
rial phyla in C57BL6/J mice are the Firmicutes (60â€“80% of se-
quences) and the Bacteroidetes  however, 85% of the
murine sequences represent species that have not been detected
in humans (Ley et al. Transplantation has also been used in
mouse models of enteric infections. Con-
versely, if the litters were split among different cages at wean-
ing, a high divergence in microbiota profiles was observed after 3
weeks.
