is diet, an element which we can control. For example,
consumption of the probiotics Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Biﬁdobacterium lactis BB12 from T1
of pregnancy in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study signiﬁcantly reduced the incidence of GDM
(P = 0.003)  However, probiotic supplementation for four weeks (weeks 24 to 28 of gestation)
in obese pregnant women did not inﬂuence maternal metabolic proﬁle, fasting blood glucose, or
pregnancy outcomes  It is possible that the short-term probiotic consumption in this study did not
permit the probiotic to induce beneﬁcial changes to the gut microbiota and hence host metabolism. found that
the glycemic response varied signiﬁcantly in response to the diﬀerent bread types and the type of bread
which induced the higher glycemic response in each person could be predicted using microbiome data
recorded just prior to the intervention. However, in its favour, gut microbiome testing represents a useful tool in its
present state to increase awareness of the gut microbiome and its inﬂuence on overall health and the
more tests that are performed, the greater the opportunity to move towards precision microbiomics by
advancing our current knowledge base. In this respect, Neville and colleagues recently proposed a variant of Koch’s postulates to provide a framework
to establish causation in the case of a single strain in human microbiota research  On the other hand, a
vegan diet high in ﬁbre aﬀects the gut ﬂora and over time the symptoms of metabolic syndrome improve—this
type of interaction may not be fully explained physiologically or may only be demonstrated statistically. Furthermore, other members of the microbiota including the phageome,
virome and mycobiome, are likely to contribute to human health as much as the bacterial component
and should be included in analysis in order to gain comprehensive insight.
