Among all mammals, the microbiota is extensively conserved at high taxonomic levels7, but
variation increases at progressively lower taxonomic levels30. Lactobacilli
represent the pioneer community in mice55 as well as humans39, preparing the
gastrointestinal tract for subsequent microbial successions, until microbial maturity is
reached..

The multiple opportunities for the microbiota to be transferred from a mother to her baby
may be disrupted by modern lifestyles. A related hypothesis is that co-evolved microbiota are
adaptive for the human species both by supporting early-in-life host functions and by
leading to later-in-life host demise 86..

The cutaneous microbiome is an obvious target in specific diseases, such as psoriasis, a
chronic, idiopathic inflammatory dermatologic condition87. Changing exposures/selection pressures on the
early-life microbiome may contribute to development of obesity.
