rates of cell turnover in germ-free animals compared with wild-type animals13. These studies support the idea that enteric pathogens
such as S. typhimurium may have developed strategies to counter both the immune system
and the microbiota during the infectious process..

IBD involves a shift from a regulated intestinal immune responses to one that is driven by
unrestrained immune-cell activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production474849. In a model of disease induced by the adoptive transfer of pathogenic T cells into
immunodeficient (Scid−/− or Rag−/−) recipient mice, colonization of animals with intestinal
pathogens such as Helicobacter hepaticus was found to exacerbate inflammation59. Future studies using animal
models whereby the microbiota can be selectively manipulated during the course of
experimental disease may begin to address this important issue..

In the early 1900s, Ilya Mechnikov was the first to propose the use of live microorganisms
to maintain bowel health and prolong life.
