Presence of haustrum and taenia coli in the colon . Gross anatomy of the human and the mouse gastrointestinal
tract. ( At  the  cellular  level,  there  are  also  a  number  of  notable
differences  between  humans  and  mice. In mice, these
cells  are  abundant  along  the  surface  of  intestinal  crypts  in  the
proximal colon but, in the distal colon and rectum, their number
decreases at the base of the crypt. For instance, Prevotella abundance
is  known  to  be  low  in  mouse  gut  microbiota  (Hildebrand  et  al., 2009)..

Recently, a study by Krych et al. 2012), Riboulet-Bisson (Riboulet-Bisson et. 2013),  being  dominated  by
Lachnospiraceae  and  Ruminococcaceae  or  Bacteroidaceae  and
Enterobacteriaceae, respectively. 2013), in which low species-richness individuals
were  found  to  have  more  pronounced  inflammation,  and  to  be
dominated by Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, the same bacterial
groups that dominated the ‘inflamed’ mouse enterotype..

Obesity
The influence of diet on the gut microbiota has received increasing
research attention over recent years. Some common trends
have emerged from this research. 2009), as well
as  of  Clostridium  coccoides and  Bifidobacterium (Sokol  et  al., 2009), and an increase in abundance of Enterobacteriaceae (such as
E. coli) (Duboc et al., However,  the  reduction  in  the  anti-inflammatory  bacterium
Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, which is observed to occur in many
human IBD studies, was not observed in murine colitis models. 2014)..

by  bacteria  on  hosts  with  different  genetic  backgrounds. This
difference  is  thought  to  be  due  to  the  fact  that  the  rat  has  a
microbiota  that  is  more  similar  to  humans  than  mice  do,  thus
facilitating the establishment of the inoculated microbiota (Wos-
