Gut Microbiota Metabolome

diseases may develop (Putignani et al., The metabolomics experiment (sampling,
sample preparation, instrumental analysis, data processing, and
data interpretation) fulﬁll the goal of improving the current
status of biological information associated to the metabolome
and, more generally, to functional genomics (Harrigan and
Goodacre, 2003). 2003); (iii) characterize microbial metabolism (Vaidyanathan
et al., Indeed, the metabolomics approach has been applied to
several studies on the gut microbiota, mostly focused on the
exploration of disease-related metabolites in order to obtain
detailed information on the gut metabolic pathways. 2012) the study of its composition helps
discriminate between unhealthy and healthy subjects. In fact, several cellular metabolites are associated with

the phenotypes of living organisms (i.e., human, mice, bacteria),
and they represent the substrates and products of diﬀerent
biochemical pathways reﬂecting genetic and environmental
factors (Kim et al., Furthermore, these data will serve as a basis to comprehend,
at the cellular and molecular levels, the relationships between
nutritional status and disease risk predisposition, thus allowing
to formulate nutritional recommendations. However, due to the chemical diversity,

the diﬀerent
properties of metabolites, and the large dynamic range of
metabolite concentrations in samples, it is almost impossible to
measure the complete metabolome with only one technique (De
