Lactobacillus crispatus  CTV-05  (Lactin-V,  Osel) 
is  a  live  biotherapeutic  product  that  contains  a 
naturally occurring vaginal strain of L. crispatus. Copyright © 2020 Massachusetts Medical Society. Trial personnel and participants were unaware 
of  the  treatment-group  assignment. In  addition,  the  associations  of 
adherence  to  the  assigned  treatment  (≥75%  of 
doses administered vs. <75% of doses adminis-
tered), reported occurrence of menses since the 
last  visit  (menses  vs.  no  menses),  and  reported 
occurrence of sexual activity (sex without the use 
of a condom vs. abstinence or sex with the use of 
a condom) with the presence of L. crispatus spe-
cies and L. crispatus CTV-05 were assessed as ex-
ploratory analyses, as specified in the statistical 
analysis plan. Safety
After the exclusion of 1 participant in the Lactin-V 
group who did not receive any doses, 151 par-
ticipants  in  the  Lactin-V  group  and  76  partici-
pants  in  the  placebo  group  were  evaluated  for 
safety;  data  on  solicited  adverse  events  were 
missing for 11 and 10 participants, respectively, 
owing to early loss to follow-up. T h e  n e w   e ng l a n d   j o u r na l   o f  m e dic i n e
