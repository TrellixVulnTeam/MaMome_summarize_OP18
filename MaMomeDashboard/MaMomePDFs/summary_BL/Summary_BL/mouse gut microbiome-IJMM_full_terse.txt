given  ecosystem. 2015),  and  mouse  strains  can  be  relatively
easily  re-derived  germ-free  (Macpherson  and  McCoy,  2015),  which
has  set  the  stage  for  the  establishment  of  gnotobiotic  models  (i.e.
mice  colonized  with  deﬁned  bacterial  strains  or  mixtures). and  their  human  host  (Comstock,
2009). Besides  the
species  mentioned  above,  numerous  other  commensal  bacteria
(the  majority  of  which  is  derived  from  humans)  have  been  used
to  interrogate  microbe–host  interactions  in  gnotobiotic  models
(Table  1). Although  models  harboring  only  few  bacteria  have  been
very  helpful,  care  must  be  taken  when  interpreting  data. The  microbiota  in  these  models  is  complex
and  thus  not  fully  characterized,  and  therefore  these  models  are
not  gnotobiotic.
