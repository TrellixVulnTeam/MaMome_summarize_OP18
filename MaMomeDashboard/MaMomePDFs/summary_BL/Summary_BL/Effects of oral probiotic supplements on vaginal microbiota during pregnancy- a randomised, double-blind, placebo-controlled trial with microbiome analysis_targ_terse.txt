Interventions
The treatment group received oral probiotic capsules con-
taining 2.5 billion CFUs each of L. rhamnosus GR-1and L.
reuteri RC-14, while the placebo group received identical
capsules containing excipients alone (Chr. Participants were instructed to take one
capsule daily until delivery and self-report compliance at
each study visit.25. two common neonatal
pathogens (Escherichia coli and Group B streptococcus),
and the composition of the vaginal microbiota..

Sample size
A sample size of 366 was calculated to estimate the propor-
tion of recruited women who would complete the study. PCR ampliﬁca-
tion at baseline failed in two participants in each group,
and the 18–20 weeks’ gestation swabs from three partici-
pants were unavailable, leaving 147 participants who pro-
vided 299 samples (75 in each group at baseline, and 74
and 75 in the probiotic and placebo groups, respectively, at
18–20 weeks’). The 16S rRNA genes were successfully
ampliﬁed and sequenced from these, and 6714 sequence
reads were sub-sampled from each sample. Microbiological assessment at 18–20 weeks
