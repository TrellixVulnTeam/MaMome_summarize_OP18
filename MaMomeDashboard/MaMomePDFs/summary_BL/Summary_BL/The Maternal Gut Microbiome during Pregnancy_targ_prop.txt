During pregnancy, inflammatory states vary from higher inflammation at implantation and 
in labor to lower levels of inflammation in mid-pregnancy (Trevisanuto et al., 2016; Kim, Romero, 
Chaemsaithong, & Kim, 2015). Probiotic milk and other food products may, therefore, be worth consideration 
for women at greater risk for gestational diabetes, preeclampsia and some environmental 
toxins..

Diet and lifestyle practices are modifiable factors that can affect the brain-gut axis, and 
ultimately, the long-term health of women and infants.
