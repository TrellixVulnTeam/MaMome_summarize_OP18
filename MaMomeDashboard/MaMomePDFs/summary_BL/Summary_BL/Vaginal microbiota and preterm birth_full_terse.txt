Microbiome profiling was based on sequen-
cing of the cpn60 universal target, which provides higher
resolution than 16S rRNA variable regions and al-
lows the resolution of Gardnerella vaginalis subgroups,
a hallmark bacteria in the disturbed microbiota 

Methods
Study population and sampling
This retrospective cohort study analysed the vaginal
microbiota of women who experienced spontaneous pre-
term birth (sPTB) and compared the resulting microbial
profiles to those of pregnant women who delivered at
term. The function aldex.clr from the ALDEx2 package in R
was used to compare the differential relative abundance
of individual taxa in term and preterm groups  Sig-
nificant differences were determined based on the false
discovery rate (FDR), which is the result of a Benjamini–
Hochberg corrected p value from a Welch’s t test calcu-
lated within ALDEx2. Ecological analysis and total bacterial load
Assessment of alpha diversity revealed that microbiomes
of women who delivered preterm were richer (Chao1
richness 46.3 ± 24.1) and more diverse (Shannon diver-
sity index 1.8 ± 1.1) when compared to those of women
in the term group 
(Table 1). d Heatmap of relative abundances of bacterial species within each vaginal microbiota. It has been reported that the com-
position of the vaginal microbiota is strongly associated
with a woman’s ethnicity  Other studies have also
demonstrated that black ethnicity is associated with an in-
creased microbiota diversity in comparison with white
ethnicity  which could have masked differences in
bacterial diversity between term and preterm cohorts in
the Romero study. TXT 336 kb)
