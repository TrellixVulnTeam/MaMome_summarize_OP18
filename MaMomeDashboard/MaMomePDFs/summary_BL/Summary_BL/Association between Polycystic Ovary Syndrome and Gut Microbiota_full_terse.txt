Competing Interests: The authors have declared
that no competing interests exist. In this experiment, 32 female SD rats were randomly assigned into 4
groups of 8 rats each, including a control group that received a gavage of normal saline, and
three treatment groups (PCOS, PCOS FMT and PCOS Lactobacillus transplantation groups)
administered a gavage of letrozole (Novartis Pharma Schweiz AG, Switzerland) at a concentra-
tion of 1 mg/kg once daily for 21 consecutive days. In order to quantify the differences of microbita for all rats on
day 21, real-time PCR analysis was applied. On the 7th day after
PCOS rats were treated with FMT, epithelial keratinocytes were observed microscopically dur-
ing estrus in the vaginal smears of 3 rats; on the 14th day epithelial keratinocytes were observed
in all of the 8 rats. In addition, many large cysts with virtually no granu-
losa layer or scant granulosa were observed. Lactobacillus plays an important role in the maintenance of human health by stimulating

the natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microbiota  A previous study
showed that postmenopausal women with a more diverse gut microbiome exhibited elevated
urinary estrogens and estrogen metabolites  In the present study, with the decrease of
estradiol and estrone levels in PCOS rats, the colonization of Lactobacillus in the gut was
decreased.
