Following screening, participants were admitted and placed on a WMD. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan was 
performed on day 2 and OGTT on day 4 of admission. Following the UF/OF phase, participants were on WMD for 2â€‰d then on 
consecutive days underwent OGTT (day 16) measurement of 24-h energy expenditure in a whole-room indirect calorimeter (day 17) and measurement of 
fasting ANGPLT4 and heparin-induced measurement of LPL (day 18). Analysis 
using unpaired Wilcoxon tests revealed 41 bacterial species with a 
significant difference (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05) in relative 
abundance  ,  with  a  skew  towards  decreased  abundance 
in the vancomycin group  Consistent 
with  our  16S  rRNA  gene  sequencing  data,  these  vancomycin-
depleted  bacteria  spanned  multiple  gram-positive  (Actinobacteria 
and  Firmicutes)  and  gram-negative  (Bacteroidetes)  phyla. This increase in stool calorie loss 
during UF and vancomycin administration occurred despite differ-
ent effects on the gut microbiota. 4 | changes in gut microbiome in response to dietary interventions.
