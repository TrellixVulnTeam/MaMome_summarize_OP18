number  of  pioneering  studies  have  employed  human-derived
Escherichia  coli  and  Bacteroides  spp. as  model  organisms  to  elucidate
key  principles  of  microbe–host  interactions  in  gnotobiotic  mice. These  bacteria  can  be  genetically  manipulated  and  allow  functional
genetic  analysis. Over  the  last
decade,  the  groups  of  Conway  and  Cohen   studied  E.  coli  car-
bohydrate  utilization  and  competition  in  the  intestine  in  detail. Thus,  the
mutant  only  transiently  colonizes  the  gut  after  which  the  mice. several  fundamental  principles  under-
lying  host–microbe  interactions  have  been  elucidated. Bacteroides
thetaiotaomicron  (B.  theta)  and  Bacteroides  fragilis  are  highly  abun-
dant  and  ubiquitous  obligate  anaerobic  members  of  the  human  gut
microbiota  (Moore  and  Holdeman,  1974;  Qin  et  al., 2003),  which  shapes  the  mutualistic  relation-
ship  between  Bacteroides  spp. and  their  human  host  (Comstock,
2009). Mono-colonization  of  mice  with  B.  theta  induces  pronounced
changes  in  host  mucosal  gene  expression  (Hooper  and  Gordon,
2001). Speciﬁcally,  B.  theta  can  modify  host  epithelial  differen-
tiation  in  a  way  that  supports  its  own   growth:  it  promotes  the
production  of  fucosylated  glycans  by  the  host  and  in  turn  uses
them  as  nutrient  sources  (Bry  et  al., 2010,  2013;  Samuel  and  Gordon,  2006). Although  models  harboring  only  few  bacteria  have  been
very  helpful,  care  must  be  taken  when  interpreting  data. In  sim-
pliﬁed  bacterial  communities,  the  context  of  a  fully  diverse  and
competitive  bacterial  ecosystem  is  lacking. Several  studies  have
therefore  started  using  deﬁned  bacterial  consortia  of  higher  com-
plexity  (Table  1).
