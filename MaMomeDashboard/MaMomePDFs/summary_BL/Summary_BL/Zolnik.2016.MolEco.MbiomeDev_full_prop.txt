the bacterial community proﬁle of blacklegged ticks
across all developmental stages (larvae, nymphs, and
adults). A total of 30
ticks per life stage were tested. This primer set, resulting in a 450- to 550-bp PCR pro-
duct, was determined to be the best candidate among
512 sets tested in terms of domain and phylum cover-
age for use in 16S rRNA bacterial sequencing (Klind-
worth et al. The PCRs were
performed in triplicate with 25 lL Phusion High-Fide-
lity PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc), 2.5 lL

of ticks to examine large numbers of ticks for each
developmental stage, while maintaining a high sequenc-
ing depth for each group. Our results indicate that much of the bacterial diver-
sity observed in these ticks is not acquired via a
bloodmeal, but transmission from female to offspring
(Rickettsia), as well as environmental acquisition, plays
important roles in shaping the microbial community
within I. scapularis.
