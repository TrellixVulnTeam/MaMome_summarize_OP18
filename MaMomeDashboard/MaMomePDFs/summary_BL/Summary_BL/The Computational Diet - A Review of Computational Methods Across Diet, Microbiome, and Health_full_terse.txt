Eetemadi et al. In this article, we summarize the research that has been
done related to DGMH, with a focus on DGMH data and
computational methods. For example, when marker gene sequencing is
used, quantities relating to the amounts of functional genes
in the microbiome are not directly available (i.e., missing). In a diﬀerent
study, the classiﬁcation task was to identify healthy vs. unhealthy
donors given relative OTU abundance data (including species
level) coming from shotgun metagenomics sequencing of the gut
(as well as other body sites) (Pasolli et al., 2016;
Eetemadi and Tagkopoulos, 2018) as well as computer vision
and natural language processing, to name a few (LeCun et al., Clustering
algorithms often require the number of clusters to be provided as
input.
