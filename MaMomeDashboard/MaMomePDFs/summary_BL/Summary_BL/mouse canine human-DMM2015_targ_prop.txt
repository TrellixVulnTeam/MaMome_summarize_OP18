Presence of haustrum and taenia coli in the colon . Conversely, in humans, goblet
cells are abundant from cecum to rectum. They are rare but present in the cecum and proximal colon
of humans, whereas, in the mouse, these cells are entirely absent in
the colonic mucosa and uniquely found in the cecum. For instance, Prevotella abundance
is  known  to  be  low  in  mouse  gut  microbiota  (Hildebrand  et  al., 2009), as well
as  of  Clostridium  coccoides and  Bifidobacterium (Sokol  et  al., However, most mouse models of colitis do not fully recapitulate the
pathophysiology of human IBD and generally only cause colonic
inflammation , which is more similar to ulcerative colitis
(reviewed in Wirtz and Neurath, 2007 and discussed further below).
