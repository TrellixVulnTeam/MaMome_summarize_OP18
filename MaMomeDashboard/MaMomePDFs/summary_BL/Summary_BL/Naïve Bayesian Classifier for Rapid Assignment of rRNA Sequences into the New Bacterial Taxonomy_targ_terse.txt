Using the RDP 9 alignment  we extracted segments cor-
responding to 100-base regions of the Escherichia coli refer-
ence sequence J01695 at 25-base intervals and used each re-
gion independently for exhaustive leave-one-out
testing,
removing the corresponding full-length sequence from training
for each test. In general, accuracy was greater for regions
mapping to the 16S hypervariable regions . Phylogenetic analysis of the Alicyclobacillaceae, including
the genera Sulfobacillus and Alicyclobacillus. Bootstrap conﬁdence estimates above 85% are
shown. This agrees with the original publication for the sequence
 The same group later reported that the sequence was probably
from S. thermosulﬁdooxidans strain K1, not VKM 1269  Two
independent sequences (X91080 and AB089844) for the type strain of
S. thermosulﬁdooxidans are available. These two sequences are 14% different, and X60602 is now de-
scribed by GenBank as from a Bacillus sp.
