proﬁle identiﬁed based on sequencing different
variable regions. However, direct asso-
ciations between speciﬁc species of Lactobacillus
and estrogen levels are lacking and warrant fur-
ther investigation..

However, the aforementioned studies were
cross-sectional, which allows for the character-
ization of a pregnancy and gestational age-com-
mon microbiome signature, but lacks capacity
for description of the dynamic changes, which
may occur in an individual over time. In a separate study, the
vaginal microbiome was examined longitudi-
nally during gestation using the V3V5 amplicon
of 16S rRNA in 12 subjects that were mostly
Caucasian (Walther-Anto´ nio et al. 2014); however,
only 14 subjects were able to be sampled in each
trimester. The maternal microbiome during infancy, and
not solely delivery mode, may be an important
factor in establishing the neonatal microbiome. Similarly, if the in-
fant was born by cesarean delivery, the infant
microbiome most closely resembled the skin
microbiome (Dominguez-Bello et al. However, further studies are necessary
to show deﬁnitively that hematogenous spread
from the oral cavity is possible for colonization
or infection of the placenta.
