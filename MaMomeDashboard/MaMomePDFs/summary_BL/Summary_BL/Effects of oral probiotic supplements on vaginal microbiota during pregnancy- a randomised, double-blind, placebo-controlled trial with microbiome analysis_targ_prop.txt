Interventions
The treatment group received oral probiotic capsules con-
taining 2.5 billion CFUs each of L. rhamnosus GR-1and L.
reuteri RC-14, while the placebo group received identical
capsules containing excipients alone (Chr. Participants were instructed to take one
capsule daily until delivery and self-report compliance at
each study visit.25. After adjusting for Nugent score at baseline,
there were no differences between the groups in the odds
of BV (adjusted OR 1.82, 95% CI 0.64–5.19; P = 0.26)..

Participants (n = 152) who attended at all time-points
were selected for the microbiome analysis. The 16S rRNA genes were successfully
ampliﬁed and sequenced from these, and 6714 sequence
reads were sub-sampled from each sample. Microbiological assessment at 18–20 weeks
