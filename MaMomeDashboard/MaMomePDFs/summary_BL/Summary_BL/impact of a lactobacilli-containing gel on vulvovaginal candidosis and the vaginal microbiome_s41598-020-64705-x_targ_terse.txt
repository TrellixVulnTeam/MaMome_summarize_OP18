First we explored in detail the in vitro inhibitory effects of a selection of LGC strains against growth and 
pathogenic properties (adhesion to vaginal cells and hyphae formation) of Candida albicans. S1)..

The lactobacilli with the strongest antimicrobial effects showed adhesive capacities of 11.3% (L. plantarum 
WCFS1), 11.8% (L. rhamnosus GG) and 34.7% (L. pentosus KCA1)  to vaginal keratinocyte cell line 
(VK2/E6E7), used as model for the vaginal epithelium. The vaginal gel was developed to ensure 
maximal exposition of living bacteria to the vaginal wall through spreading after intravaginal application and 
maintain a high viability. The concentration of viable lactobacilli did decline during storage at 25 °C, 
showing roughly a ten-fold reduction after 6 months of storage..

proof-of-concept study in patients with VVc. In most women the lactobacillus that 
dominated the bacterial community before treatment (visit 1) was also dominant at the end of the study, after the 
treatment (visit 4), indicating the applied lactobacilli had a temporary effect on the microbiome (Supplemental
