In studies on urinary microbiomes, the degree of concentration 
of  bacteria  habiting  in  urinary  systems  may  vary  according  to 
the sex, the method of urine collection, and the technique used 
to  study  UM. Both microorganisms are lactic acid 
bacteria and have protective roles against pathogens colonized 
in the urogenital region. Inadequate treatment 
of  genitourinary  infections  and  recurrence  lead  to  the  shift  of 
Lactobacillus  dominancy  in  the  normal  flora  to  the  coliform 
uropathogens..

Since  the  vaginal  microflora  is  intended  to  be  corrected,  pro-
biotics  that  prevent  and  treat  genitourinary  infections  should 
contain Lactobacillus species. If  pathogenic  bacteria  can 
achieve this, then why Lactobacillus, an important component 
of  vaginal  colonization,  can  not  do  it? In the analysis, it was 
stated that the ovules containing combinations of L.crispatus CTV-
05 or  L. rhamnosus GR-1 and  L.fermentum B-54  were the most 
effective methods and that higher number of randomized clinical 
trials were needed for the evaluation of oral probiotic treatments..

Side  effects  due  to  Lactobacillus  prophylaxis  were  investi-
gated  in  7  of  the  studied  studies,  and  any  side  effects  were 
not observed in 4 of them and in the remaining 3 studies mild 
headache,  and  increased  appetite  or  fever  was  observed. Researchers noted that 
the combination was well tolerated and effective.
