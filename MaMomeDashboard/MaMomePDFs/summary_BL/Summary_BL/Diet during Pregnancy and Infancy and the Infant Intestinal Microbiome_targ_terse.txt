In unadjusted analyses of 4 genera selected a priori based
on prior literature suggesting associations with early diet and
health outcomes,7-10,22-25 we found that high maternal intake
of vegetables and low intake of processed meats and deep fried
foods was inversely associated with Bacteroides spp (decrease. Linear regression was used in analyses of Shannon Index, and richness and negative binomial regression was used in analysis of bacterial counts. b coefficients of bacterial counts represent a
difference in the log count, formula fed is reference. †Dietary variables: infant breastfeeding vs formula feeding and infant solid food. Excluding race/ethnicity
from the model, the interaction between breastfeeding status
and maternal education was not signiﬁcant for either
Biﬁdobacterium spp (P = .45) or Lactobacillus spp (P = .73),
further supporting stronger associations of microbial differ-
ences by infant diet group with race/ethnicity than maternal
education..

We identiﬁed signiﬁcant differences in relative abun-
dances of taxa between breastfed and formula- fed infants in
adjusted analyses stratiﬁed by race/ethnicity (Figure 3 and
Table VI; available at www.jpeds.com). There were interactions between race/ethnicity and breastfeeding
vs formula on relative abundances of Biﬁdobacterium and Lactobacillus (P ≤ .10) in negative binomial regression analyses..
