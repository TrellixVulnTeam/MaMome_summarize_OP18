The fluxes through these pools vary by fiber source and microbial pathways dictated by 
microbial community composition of the lumen. While acetate is a dominant end product of 
glycolysis, cross-feeding between groups of bacteria occurs and can influence SCFA 
pools.38 Butyrate forming bacteria condense acetate from butyrl CoA and external pools of 
acetate.39, 40 Use of external pools of acetate varies among bacterial species and may alter 
the amount of acetate and butyrate available to the host. only derived 28%.41 In addition, different 
sources of carbohydrates produce different amounts of butyrate ranging from 56% with 
pectin to 90% for xylan. Previous studies have 
shown that certain species of bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Bacteroides 
thetaiotaomicron, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Peptostreptococcus sp. In support of this 
hypothesis, we showed recently that the fecal bacteria from individuals who excrete higher 
amounts of ITC in their urine after a standard meal of cooked broccoli metabolize more 
glucoraphanin in-vitro.61.
