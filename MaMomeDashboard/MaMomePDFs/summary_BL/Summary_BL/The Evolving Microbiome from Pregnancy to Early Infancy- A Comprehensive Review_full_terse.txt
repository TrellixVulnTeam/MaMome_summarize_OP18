1. A meta-analysis reported signiﬁcant diversity diﬀerences in vaginal
microbiomes in the ﬁrst trimester, between women with term and preterm outcomes, indicating
a potential diagnostic utility of microbiome-related biomarkers  In addition, the increase of
pathogens in the vagina is associated with complications of pregnancy, in particular with an increased
risk of preterm birth and spontaneous abortion

2.3. Changes in the Microbiome Related to the Type of Delivery

There is great controversy in the scientiﬁc community about the relationship of the meconium
and infant gut microbiota proﬁle, and the type of delivery. In addition, it has also been suggested that the transfer of maternal vaginal
microbes plays a minor role in seeding infant stool microbiota since the overlap of maternal vaginal
microbiota and infant faecal microbiota is minimal, while the similarity between maternal rectal
microbiota and infant microbiota was more pronounced 

The discrepances of the results obtained could be due to diﬀerent factors associated to C-section
delivery such as antibiotic administration, but also to breastfeeding, maternal obesity, gestational
diabetes mellitus, and even the analytical methodology. Furthermore, a correlation between the
presence of certain taxa in sputum and the clinical course of community acquired pneumonia has been
described 

HIV infected children present reduced gastrointestinal microbial diversity  Modulation of
the intestinal microbiome through nutritional supplementation, with the aim of decreasing bacterial
permeability, has been attempted in the context of HIV infection with scarce success 
In addition, the microbiome has been suggested to impact the risk of diﬀerent infectious diseases.
