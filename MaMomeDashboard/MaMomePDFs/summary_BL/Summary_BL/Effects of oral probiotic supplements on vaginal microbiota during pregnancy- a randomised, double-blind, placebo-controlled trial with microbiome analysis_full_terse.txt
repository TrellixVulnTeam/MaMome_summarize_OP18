Probiotics might be a safe and effective alternative to
antibiotics in restoring the imbalance of the vaginal micro-

participants were asked to report on antibiotic use and any
side effects from the intervention. Participants (n = 152) who attended at all time-points
were selected for the microbiome analysis. The stability of the microbiota within subjects
assessed by determining the theta-YC distance between the
baseline and 18–20 weeks’ gestation samples was not signif-
icantly different between the probiotic and placebo groups
(Wilcoxon). The rate of PTB is rising globally45 and cur-
rent strategies to stem its growth are ineffective.46 The
association between BV and PTB, and the reported beneﬁts
of probiotic therapy on BV, mainly in non-pregnant
women, have raised interest in the role of probiotics in the
prevention of PTB.47 The observed beneﬁt of dietary probi-
otic intake on the risk of spontaneous PTB48 supports this
concept. The study was sup-
ported by the NIHR CRN portfolio with recruitment and
follow up of participants, and was sponsored by Queen
Mary University of London.
