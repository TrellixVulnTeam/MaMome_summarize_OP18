Here, we present below examples of the role of the microbiome in dietary metabolism, an 
overview of eukaryotic epigenetic mechanisms, and microbially-derived metabolites that are 
relevant to eukaryotic epigenetic changes in gene expression that may be linked to colon 
cancer. Further studies in wild-type and APC 
Min/+ mice showed that a single dose of SFN reduced HDAC activity and increase histone 
acetylation in colonic mucosa.63 Additionally, SFN has been identified as a DNA 
demethylating agent in breast cancer cell lines although this has not been verified in colon 
tissue.64

Polyphenols represent a wide variety of phytochemicals that are divided into several classes 
according to their chemical structures. Most of the bile acids are absorbed in the ileum and delivered back 
to the liver. Azoxymethane (AOM) tumor 
induction in rats fed either fish showed that the 
fish oil intervention produced fewer tumors and the lowest number of differentially express 
miRNAs.95 The anaerobic bacteria, Roseburia, Bifidobacteria, and Lactobacillus, found in 
the distal gut, metabolize 3ω LC-PUFA from dietary intake to conjugated linolenic (CLnA) 
acids.96, 97 Although 3ω LC-PUFA are not produced by bacteria, the availability of 3ω LC-

Cancer J. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 May 01. Functional genes measured in the gut 
microbiome suggest that there are basic metabolic pathways that are conserved across all 
healthy individuals114, 115 which have the core capacity to generate compounds that 
influence epigenetic pathways of gene expression.109, 110 While colonic epithelium may 
have immediate exposure to microbial metabolites, many microbial products are absorbed 
into systemic circulation and may alter gene expression in regions distal to the gut. Summary and Future Directions
