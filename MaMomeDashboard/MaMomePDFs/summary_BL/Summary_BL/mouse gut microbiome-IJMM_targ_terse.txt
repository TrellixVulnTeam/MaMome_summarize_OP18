number  of  pioneering  studies  have  employed  human-derived
Escherichia  coli  and  Bacteroides  spp. as  model  organisms  to  elucidate
key  principles  of  microbe–host  interactions  in  gnotobiotic  mice. These  bacteria  can  be  genetically  manipulated  and  allow  functional
genetic  analysis. Over  the  last
decade,  the  groups  of  Conway  and  Cohen   studied  E.  coli  car-
bohydrate  utilization  and  competition  in  the  intestine  in  detail. Speciﬁcally,  B.  theta  can  modify  host  epithelial  differen-
tiation  in  a  way  that  supports  its  own   growth:  it  promotes  the
production  of  fucosylated  glycans  by  the  host  and  in  turn  uses
them  as  nutrient  sources  (Bry  et  al., 2010,  2013;  Samuel  and  Gordon,  2006).
