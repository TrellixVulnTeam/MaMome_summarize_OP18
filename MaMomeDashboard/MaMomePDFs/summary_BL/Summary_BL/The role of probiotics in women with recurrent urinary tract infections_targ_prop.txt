In studies on urinary microbiomes, the degree of concentration 
of  bacteria  habiting  in  urinary  systems  may  vary  according  to 
the sex, the method of urine collection, and the technique used 
to  study  UM. Both microorganisms are lactic acid 
bacteria and have protective roles against pathogens colonized 
in the urogenital region. Lactobacillus, Prevotella, 
Gardnerella, Peptoniphilus, 
Dialister, Finegoldia, 
Anaerococcus, Allisonella, 
Streptococcus, Staphylococcus. Inadequate treatment 
of  genitourinary  infections  and  recurrence  lead  to  the  shift  of 
Lactobacillus  dominancy  in  the  normal  flora  to  the  coliform 
uropathogens..

Since  the  vaginal  microflora  is  intended  to  be  corrected,  pro-
biotics  that  prevent  and  treat  genitourinary  infections  should 
contain Lactobacillus species. In  the  group  of  nitrofuran-
toin, microbiota structure demonstrated relatively lower degree 
of variations..

In their study, Zucotti et al.stated that probiotics could be a 
good alternative to antibiotic therapy because of their ability to 
bind  to  uroepithelial  cells  and  inhibit  pathogenic  growth,  and 
biosurfactant  secretion. If  pathogenic  bacteria  can 
achieve this, then why Lactobacillus, an important component 
of  vaginal  colonization,  can  not  do  it? In 
addition,  antibiotic  resistance  was  significantly  reduced  in  the 
probiotic  group  compared  to  the  control  group. These patients were 
divided into two groups and for 10 weeks following an episode 
of cystitis placebo treatment was given to 48 patients, and other 
48  patients  received  intravaginal  probiotics  (Lactin-V)  contain-
ing  Lactobacillus  crispatus    The  results  of  this 
study showed that the incidence of recurrent UTIs in patients who 
received  intravaginal  Lactobacillus  treatment  decreased  signifi-
cantly compared to the placebo group. . Researchers noted that 
the combination was well tolerated and effective.
