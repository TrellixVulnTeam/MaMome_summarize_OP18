The fucose metabolism pathway score showed a direct relation-
ship  with  PPGR. Fucose  is  a  sugar  molecule  that  various  microbial 
organisms  can  use  as  an  energy  source  [Chen  1987].  When  other 
carbohydrate sources are not available, gut microbiota can switch to 
using  the  fucose  that  can  be  obtained  from  the  hostâ€™s  gut  mucosal 
lining. This may 
explain its association with higher PPGR.
